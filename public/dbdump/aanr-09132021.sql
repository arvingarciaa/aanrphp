It has become the Council\'s platform for joint R&amp;D planning, monitoring, evaluation, and sharing of resources among member institutions to achieve development of the agriculture, aquatic and natural resources sector in the regions.&nbsp;</p><p>The Consortia system started in 1975 with the establishment of the first consortium in Region 6, La Granja Agricultural Research Center, consisting of four member agencies. Other research centers and stations in other regions followed suit and also entered into consortium arrangements. By 1978, there were additional seven consortia established for Bicol, Central Luzon, Cagayan Valley, CAR, Ilocos Norte, Northern and Central Mindanao, and Eastern Visayas.&nbsp;</p><p>By 1988, 14 regional consortia were operating all across the country. With the rationalization of the PCAARRD support in 2012, 12 consortia remained operational together with the addition of the newly-formed ARMMAARRDEC. With the renewed commitment to support the consortia in 2015, the revival of CCAARRD and CVAARRDEC (formerly CV-CIRRD) was materialized in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>There are now 15 consortia operating in the country, with the newest member of MAARRDEC formed in 2019.</p><p>Membership has expanded through the years and varies in each consortium. As of January 2021, the Consortia have a total membership of 288 agencies – 206 R&amp;D implementing (SUCs, regional offices of the DENR and DA, private universities, NGOs) and 82 non-R&amp;D implementing (BAR, ATI, LGUs, DOST, NEDA, DAR, DBM, DTI, DoT, among others).&nbsp; Also, many consortia already have members coming from the private sector.</p><p>PCAARRD provides funding support to the Consortia’s initiatives under the four banner programs of strategic R&amp;D, R&amp;D results utilization, institution development, and policy research and advocacy.&nbsp; The Council also institutes capability building measures and other means of support to ensure that the Consortia are able to perform as “PCAARRD in the regions.”</p>','Dr. Reynaldo V.

Cells were 80% confluent after 4–6 d of culture, with predomi-nantly fibroblast-like type of cells, which were eventually overgrown with epithelioid type of cells after7 d of culture. The cell monolayers lasted for 3–4 wk with regular replacement of the growth medium.Subsequent experiments showed that MBV and WSSV replicated in the primary lymphoid cell cultures.Seven-day-old cell monolayers inoculated with two-fold dilutions of viral suspensions of either MBV orWSSV exhibited localized cytopathic effects (CPE) after 1–2 d of incubation at 28 ºC. Early CPE showedthe presence of highly refractile bodies and cell shrinkage; advanced cellular degeneration was ob-served after 3-4 d incubation, especially in monolayers which were inoculated with the higher viraldilutions. Significant cellular degeneration took a longer time to develop in cells inoculated with thelowest dilutions of WSSV. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were done to confirm MBV andWSSV infection of the cells. Positive MBV and WSSV infections were detected in all samples, except inthose inoculated with the lowest viral dilutions, at the nested PCR step only. Subsequent passages (2ndand 3rd) of harvested cell suspension on cultured lymphoid cells likewise produced CPE from day-3post-inoculation.

The analysis was implemented byreplacing inputs with crude petroleum with bioethanol, which is sourced from the sugar industry, in thepetroleum refining industry. The study found that the initiative raises the output of the ‘Agriculture, Fishery and Forestrysector’. However, this is driven mostly by the expansion of the output of the sugar industry, with a largeproportion of the industries in the sector experiencing a contraction in output. The analysis also showsthat promoting sugar as a biofuel feedstock can have adverse effects on food security.

Close-out information consisting of 2445 pens of steers and 965 pensof heifers included information on start and end dates, cattle per pen, sex, housing type, days on feed,initial and sale weight, feed conversion (FC), proportion of concentrate, average daily gain (ADG),percent death loss, feed cost and total cost per 45.35 kg gain, breakeven sale price, non-feed variablecost, non-feed fixed cost and corn price. Daily DMI was not provided but was calculated as DMI = ADGx FC. Regression model included initial weight and, thus, DMI was regressed on initial weight forsteers, heifers and combination of both. When the model was applied separately for steers, heifersand including both sexes, DMI prediction for steers was found as DMI = 5.81 + 0.0125*Initial weight(n=2445, r2=0.41), whereas DMI prediction for heifers was found as DMI = 5.03 + 0.0144*Initial weight(n=965, r2=0.38). When steers and heifers were combined, DMI prediction was found as DMI = 5.49 +0.0133*Initial weight (n=3410, r2=0.43). These results are similar to those obtained by NRC (1996)where DMI = 4.54 + 0.0125*Initial weight. These prediction models predict average feed intake through-out a feeding period and implies that initial weight of cattle is related to average DMI during a feedingperiod. Slope for heifers was higher than that of steers, implying that heifers had a greater increase inDMI throughout a feeding period per unit of initial body weight.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/PAS/article/view/55','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','H.

All soybean plots received full irrigation during the vegetative stage, while treatments were started during one of the reproductive stages (R1-2, beginning of flowering and full bloom; R3, beginning of pod; R4, full pod; R5, beginning of seed; R6, full seed and full irrigation) by completely stopping irrigation. In 2003 and 2004, the observed leaf area index ranged from 3.9 (R6) to 2.6 (control), and from 4.0 (R6) to 2.7 (control), respectively. Water stress resulted in reduced vegetative growth, leaf relative water content and leaf chlorophyll content. In 2003 and 2004 seed yields ranged from 1955 (R6) to 3684 kg ha-1 (control), and from 1867 (R6) to 3952 kg ha-1 (control), respectively. Any water stress imposed on soybean plants in R3, R5 and R6 resulted in substantial yield reduction compared with the full irrigated control treatment. There were no significant effects of total chlorophyll and leaf relative water content on the oil and protein content of soybean seed. Water stress during the different reproductive stages (R1–R6) significantly affected protein content, C18:0, C18:2 and C18:3 fatty acids. The lowest protein value was obtained in R1-2, while the highest values were obtained from R4 in both years. Water stress effect imposed on any of the reproductive stages showed a significant effect on protein content but not seed oil. The highest protein content values were obtained from R4 treatment at 42.5% and 42.1% in 2003 and 2004, respectively, while the lowest values were from R5 and R1-2 at 37.9% and 38.9% in 2003 and 2004, respectively.

Three distinct oleosins were shown by their cDNA sequences: OLE300a, OLE500a and OLE500c, with OLE500a being the major isoform. These isoforms were observed in solid endosperm of 6–7 and 9–10 month old samples but not in the mature 11–12 month sample. Southern blot analysis showed two copies of OLE 500a gene.

E. coli was also isolated from these chickens after being fed such for 23 d. The antibiograms of the isolates were determined using the disk diffusion method. The prevalence of E. coli isolates from fish and chickens on the integrated farm that were resistant to tetracycline and chloramphenicol, to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those from fish in the control farm. In addition, the diversity of resistance was also greater among E. coli from the integrated farm group, which concurs with the results of other studies that exposure to antimicrobials results in higher prevalence of resistant isolates as a consequence of positive selection. On the other hand, the prevalence of resistant E. coli from fish and chickens on the integrated farm that received and those that did not receive antibiotics in their feeds were not significantly different (p > 0.05), indicating that exposure to antimicrobials was not required for the occurrence and maintenance of resistant strains.

Analytical tools used were thin layer chromatography (TLC) for the separation of the acylglycerol classes, gas liquid chromatography (GC), high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and a combination of HPLC-GC to determine the triacylglycerol (TAG) molecular species in terms of carbon number (CN) and equivalent carbon number (ECN). Stereospecific analysis, which is the distribution of the fatty acids in the glycerol backbone, was carried out using pancreatic lipase (E.C.3.1.1.3) and phospholipase A2 (E.C.3.1.1.4). The major TAG species was the fraction ECN 36 containing CN 36–42 acyl carbons. Stereoanalyses showed that lauric (C12) acid was the major fatty acid in the three positions of the glycerol moiety. Saturated fatty acids showed a general preference for the external positions, while the unsaturated fatty acids oleic and linoleic occurred predominantly at the sn-2 positions. Lauric (C12) followed by myristic (C14) and palmitic (C12) acids were preferentially esterified at the sn-1 position.

A complexity index of the corona shape was computed using the variation between consecutive EF functions. Principal component analysis was used to select the Fourier coefficients with the best discriminatory power. Differences among the species were summarized in a total of nine independent shape characteristics after principal component analysis of the shape data was done. Higher shape variance (56.13%) is attributed to asymmetries in the shapes of the corona. Cluster analysis based on the shapes of the corona recognized at least three groups of corona shapes.

Leaf contours of 16 species of Hoya were compared using this type of outline analysis. Detailed examinations of the leaves were done by performing three separate analyses: one for the overall shape variation using all Fourier descriptors and one each for the symmetric and asymmetric coefficients of the shape descriptors. Leaf shape variation within species was found to be continuous and, because of this, traditional approaches may not be enough to describe the extent of leaf shape diversity within or among taxa. Independent aspects of shape variation were also identified, where more than 96% were related to symmetrical variations that included differences in the length-to-width ratio, location of the widest portion of the leaf, tip shape and width near the leaf base. Five asymmetrical variations were scored which included overall asymmetry (wider on left vs. right), base asymmetry and tip asymmetry. Few leaf shape types were found based on the cluster analysis of the group centroids derived from discriminant analysis and reconstruction of the mean leaf shapes per species, suggesting structural constraints in leaf shape evolution in this group of plants.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/PAS/article/view/5','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Mark Anthony  Torres, Cesar  Demayo, Simeona  Siar','null',NULL,15,5,4,'University of the Philippines Los Baños',3,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(62,'2021-07-29 13:11:26','2021-07-29 13:11:26','Reproductive Potential, Feeding and Oviposition Preferences of the Mango Pulp Weevil, Sternochetus frigidus (Fabr.)

This study explored the likely impact and viability of the options available to fishery managers to sustain coastal fisheries in these bays. Using recent data from the Fisheries Resource Management Program and an updated, bay-level version of the steady-state model FISHBE (Fisheries Information for Sustainable Harvests-BioEconomic), thousands of individual model runs were made and reduced to fishing capacity charts, which are introduced here as graphical guide for managers to allow them to examine the consequences of various scenarios. Results showed that both bays are still overfished. FISH-BE estimates revealed only around 1,100 of the 1,500 municipal fishers in Calauag Bay can be supported sustainably over the long term (i.e., > 5 yr) under current conditions. Tayabas Bay’s fisheries are in a more critical state because it has six times more fishers but the bay is only three times larger in area than Calauag Bay. FISH-BE simulations showed only 2,800 of about 9,500 municipal fishers in Tayabas Bay could be supported sustainably over the long term. If all 1,500 fishers are to be supported, at least 20% (150 km2) of Calauag Bay should be set aside as no-take sanctuaries. For Tayabas Bay, if the number of municipal fishers is not reduced, no-take fish sanctuaries totaling at least 55% of the bay’s waters (or 1,385 km2) need to be set up.

The experiments were done in artificial housing and were carried out in 5 x 3 factorial arrangements with four replications for the water quality indicators, the biomass of water mimosa and heavy metal contamination. Concentrations of 0% (control), 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% distilled slop in contaminated water at 10, 20 and 30 d treatment periods were evaluated. The initial biomass of the water mimosa for all treatments was 0.200 kg per 50 L of effluent. The removal efficiency of soluble solids at all concentrations of distilled slop and treatment time was 89.3–96.3%. The removal efficiencies of biological oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand at all concentrations of distilled slop were optimal at 10 d treatment (42.9–70.4% and 8.27–25.0%, respectively); higher efficiency was obtained when the concentration of the distilled slop decreased from 20% to 0%. The removal efficiency of total dissolved solids and total kjeldahl nitrogen and the pH neutral control efficiency were not found in this study. pH, total dissolved solids and total kjeldahl nitrogen increased with treatment time and with an increase in the concentration of distillery slop. The biomass of water mimosa at all concentrations of distilled slop increased at 10 d but tended to decrease with longer treatment period and an increase in the concentration of the distilled slop. The biomass of water mimosa at all concentrations of distilled slop was higher than that of the control at all treatment times. Nitrogen volatilization and transformation affected the kjeldahl nitrogen (KN) removal rate of distilled slop at all concentrations, whereas adsorption of nutrients in the water mimosa had no effect on the KN removal rate because the death rate of water mimosa was high. The concentration of the heavy metals Pb, Cd and Hg in water contaminated with distilled slop was acceptable.

Concepcion Uno, Marikina City; d) Bgy. 169, Caloocan City; and e) Paref Woodrose School, Inc., Muntinlupa City. Compost from Bgy 169 passed the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA) standard for compost or soil conditioner. Chemical analyses showed that the compost had a C:N ratio of 21 and contained 39% organic matter, 1.08% total N, 0.81% P as P 2O5 and 1.58% K as K2O. It was free of pathogenic coliforms and had no traces of the toxic metals Pb and Cd. Its Zn content was 103.67 ppm, way below the allowable limit of 1000 ppm. However, the other four composting ventures had poor compost quality with a C:N ratio of over 40 but the composts were also relatively free of pathogenic coliforms and the toxic metals Pb and Cd. Financial analysis showed that the direct costs of producing compost ranged from PhP1,515 – PhP13,654 per ton, which were greater than the income or value from the compost produced. This could be due to the relatively low price of the product because of its poor quality. Composting entailed a financial gap that ranged from PhP 551–PhP10,946 per ton, which must be bridged from other sources, if not subsidized by the local government. However, if indirect benefits such as the value of savings from avoided landfill and collection costs are considered, the composting activities are economically or socially beneficial due to positive economic gains.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/PAS/article/view/11','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Virginia  Cuevas, Zenaida  Sumalde, Sixto  Valencia, Constancio  de Guzman','biowaste, C:N ratio, composting, solid waste management, toxic metals',NULL,15,5,4,'University of the Philippines Los Baños',3,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(68,'2021-07-29 13:11:26','2021-07-29 13:11:26','Effects of Sexual Restraint and Stimulation of Boars on Fertility and Fecundity Rate in Sows','2019-03-19','The Philippine Agricultural Scientist Vol 91 No 1 (2008): The Philippine Agricultural Scientist Sixty Large White sows (aged 2.0 yr) and 12 boars of the same breed and age were used to study the relative dependence of sow fertility and fecundity rate on the sexual stimulation of boars. Boars were subjected to two different sexual stimulation procedures. In the first, four boars were assigned to each of the three treatment groups involving 0, 5 and 10 min of sexual restraint (R) per 30 min test period. In the second, the 12 boars were randomly reassigned to 6 treatment combinations involving 0, 5 and 10R and two levels (5 and 10 min) of libido tests (reaction time) per 30 min period. Libido was recorded as the reaction time (RT) (in minutes) and was defined as the time from intromission to ejaculation. Semen was collected by the use of an artificial vagina device following sexual stimulation, and analyzed for quantitative and qualitative parameters using standard methodology. Semen from each boar was artificially inseminated (AI) to 5 sows twice, 12 and 24 h after the onset of the first oestrus. Fertility was determined as non-return rate, which was observed as the proportion of females that conceived, divided by the total number in a herd of sows that were artificially inseminated. Fecundity was measured in terms of the percentage of sows that farrowed and the total number of piglets (litter size) born per litter. Results from the first procedure indicated that 5 min of sexual restraint (5R) was necessary to achieve the highest sexual drive at the shortest reaction time of 2.8 min. The 5R boars produced semen that gave the highest semen viability and fertility in AI sows compared with the 10R and 10R, respectively. In the second procedure, 5 min sexual restraint combined with 5 min reaction time (5R-5RT) produced an overall advantage in improving the sperm viability and fertility of AI sows, compared with the various groups in both the first and second procedures. Results of the two experimental procedures showed that in comparison, boars in the 5R vs. the 5R-RT groups produced semen with the highest sperm cell motility (80.7 ± 0.25 vs. 83.6 ± 0.34%), progressive movement (6.8 ± 0.25 vs. 8.7 ± 0.53), acrosomal NAR (90.0 ± 6.61 vs. 91.4 ± 0.22%), non-return rate (82.5 ± 0.18 vs. 90.0 ± 0.2%), farrowing rate (85.5 0.43 vs. 88.1 ± 0.06%) and the largest number (7.4 ± 0.11 vs. 8.3 ± 0.05) of piglets per litter with the greatest proportion (5.5 ± 0.19 vs. 7.3 ± 0.05 piglets) farrowed alive. The results suggest that sexual stimulation of boars significantly enhanced semen viability of the boars, with concomitant improvement in fecundity and non-return rate of AI sows. The 5 min of sexual restraint in conjunction with 5 min reaction time (5R-5RT) of boars were most suitable for use in AI services.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/PAS/article/view/12','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Dennis  Umesiobi','boar sexual restraint, libido, non-return rate, semen viability, sow fecundity',NULL,15,5,4,'University of the Philippines Los Baños',3,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(69,'2021-07-29 13:11:26','2021-07-29 13:11:26','Phylogenetic Affiliation of the “Endong” “Spaghetti” Variety of Eucheuma as Revealed by Molecular Data','2019-03-19','The Philippine Agricultural Scientist Vol 91 No 1 (2008): The Philippine Agricultural Scientist A carrageenan-producing seaweed locally referred to as “Endong”/ “Spaghetti” and initially regarded by farmers as a variety of Kappaphycus on the basis of morphological similarity has recently been shown to be a variety of Eucheuma, as indicated by its histological features and carrageenan type. Considering its unique combination of characteristics, it is of interest to determine the phylogenetic relationship of this seaweed with Kappaphycus and Eucheuma varieties.

Two samples separately collected from two sites (referred to by farmers as “Endong” and “Spaghetti”) were used.

The four strains were then compared by reisolation from the inoculated plants, DNA extraction and repetitive extragenic palindromic - polymerase chain reaction (REP-PCR) fingerprinting. Out of the 542 fingerprinted DNA samples from reisolations, two of the strains, one of which was T523, had isolates which manifested variable REP fingerprints. An isolate, T523-731, had a missing 0.4 kb band and additional bands of about 0.7 kb and 0.45 kb. Reinoculation of T523-731 on the same set of tomato cultivars resulted in an average wilting of 96% on two resistant cultivars (C108 and 508) and 17% on the highly resistant cultivar Hawaii 7996. In contrast, reinoculation of an isolate (T523-726) that exhibited the fingerprint of the parent strain, resulted in 16.7% wilting in cv. 508 but did not cause wilting in cvs. C-108 and Hawaii 7996. The parent strain T523 caused 3% wilting in cv. 508, and similarly did not cause wilting in cvs. C- 108 and Hawaii 7996. Similar results were obtained with a subsequent virulence test.

The average heterozygosities, genetic distances and FST values of specimens from the four sites were very low, suggesting that the native and transplanted populations had very low genetic variation and that they were genetically homogeneous despite the presence of morphological variation.

The disease has also been exported to other countries, including the Philippines, but the level of spread is still under control (as of 08 February 2020). To describe and predict the dynamics of the disease, several preliminary mathematical models are formulated by various international study groups. Here, the insights that can be drawn from these models are discussed, especially as inputs for designing strategies to control the epidemics. Proposed model-based strategies on how to prevent the spread of the disease in local setting, such as during social gatherings, are also presented. The model shows that the exposure time is a significant factor in spreading the disease. As crowd density increases, the higher the chance an infected person could infect other people. The attendees of the social gathering should have effective protection or preventive measures (e.g., administrative and engineering controls) to minimize further disease transmission. ','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/JESAM/article/view/329','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Jomar Rabajante','coronavirus, Wuhan, infectious diseases, mathematical modeling, huge crowd',NULL,15,5,4,'University of the Philippines Los Baños',3,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(73,'2021-07-29 13:11:26','2021-07-29 13:11:26','Estimation of Basic Wood Density and its Uncertainty for Quercus Species in South Korea','2020-06-30','Journal of Economics, Management and Agricultural Development Vol 23 No 1 (2020) Basic wood density is recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as one of the parameters that can accurately estimate carbon stocks of trees.

This method avoided errors caused by the pollutant flux and considered the situations of reciprocating flow and acceptable water quality; and the “Pollutant treatment cost (PTC) method” was considered suitable for immediate implementation, although the payment was higher at 245 million CNY (35.4 million USD). The determination of compensation criterion using this method had a scientific basis, but it required perfect and reliable monitoring data. If these conditions are met, the method was considered suitable for future implementation. ','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/JESAM/article/view/333','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Jianjian  Wang, Jie  Zhou, Qiaohua  Zhao, Yong  Pang, Junjie  Jia, Hongche Pan','Eco-compensation payment, Taihu pilot region, Water quality exceedance rate method, Pollutant treatment cost method',NULL,15,5,4,'University of the Philippines Los Baños',3,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(76,'2021-07-29 13:11:26','2021-07-29 13:11:26','Exploring Spatial Relationship Between Electrical Conductivity and Spectral Salinity Indices in the Mekong Delta','2020-06-30','Journal of Economics, Management and Agricultural Development Vol 23 No 1 (2020) The negative impact of salinization concurrent with drought is a severe problem that creates challenges for agriculture in deltas and coastal lowlands. This study aims to investigate the spatial relationship among the field measured electrical conductivity (EC) and spectral salinity indices derived from Remote sensed data in the Mekong Delta using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). A wide range of Landsat 8 Operational Land Images (OLI) products, including single bands, band ratios, vegetation indices (NDVI and EVI), intensity indices (INT), and brightness indices (BI) were employed for computing salinity indices. The Kriging and Co-kriging interpolation techniques were used to estimate the spatial pattern of the field measured EC. Additionally, the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression were employed to characterize the relationship between single bands and EC measurement before applying the GWR for exploring the spatial correlation among the indices. There was a gradually increased of EC value from inland to coastal area. A significant relationship between EC measurement and spectral salinity indices and the highest correlation coefficient with p value less than 0.05 was found in EVI (r2 = 0.736). This study demonstrated that the GWR is germane to analyse the spatial correlation among the mentioned variables in the study area. Moreover, it also revealed that spectral salinity indices could be an alternative option for EC measurement in monitoring salt water intrusion at coastal areas. ','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/JESAM/article/view/334','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Thuong  Tran, Duy  Tran, Hoa  Pham, Tuan  Truong, Hoanh Trinh, Dung  Nguyen, Binh  Nguyen, Hanh  Nguyen','Geographically Weighted Regression, Salinization, Salinity Index, EC measurement,, Ben Tre',NULL,15,5,4,'University of the Philippines Los Baños',3,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(77,'2021-07-29 13:11:26','2021-07-29 13:11:26','Evaluation of Anticipated Performance Index of Tree Species for Air Pollution Mitigation in Islamabad, Pakistan','2020-06-30','Journal of Economics, Management and Agricultural Development Vol 23 No 1 (2020) There is ever increasing problem of air pollution in cities due to urbanization, industrialization, population growth and increased number of vehicles.

Some of the endemic bird species in the Sulu Archipelago have not been observed in the wild for decades and may already have gone extinct without being noticed. This study uses available information to describe the current status of endemic bird species in the area. Most of the information were gathered from anecdotal reports of birdwatchers who visited the area since very few scientific surveys have been done there. All of the Sulu endemic bird species are forest dependent and categorized as threatened on the IUCN Red List. The Sulu Bleeding-heart Gallicolumba menagei has not been recorded for over a century. The Sulu Hornbill Anthrococeros montani may have no more than 20 pairs left in the wild and not much more is known of the Sulu Hawk-Owl Ninox reyi apart from its name and call.

Many aquaculture ponds are situated along the river system and obtain water from the river. In order to address this problem, phytoremediation or the use of plants was tested as a low-cost remediation system to reduce the pollution on the ponds. The vetiver grass was utilized because of its unique features and its ability to accumulate heavy metals. A vetiver pontoon was established on fishponds located at Brgy. Nagbalon, Marilao and Brgy. Liputan, Meycauayan. The vetiver roots and leaves were analyzed for heavy metal content. There is an accumulation of toxic heavy metals such as lead, chromium, manganese and copper in the roots and leaves. Manganese had the highest accumulated metal by the vetiver grass. It was observed that there is a significant difference of heavy metal absorption of Pb, Zn, Mn and Cr through time. The vetiver grass favored accumulating heavy metals in the roots based on the translocation factor (TF). Vetiver grass can potentially improve some water quality parameters such as lowering levels of ammonia, BOD and COD and absorb heavy metals such as Pb, Zn, Mn and Cr which are harmful to fish.

Hence, classifying pollution must be inclusive of crucial locations and temporal variabilities. This study applied various statistical techniques to look into the spatial and temporal trends of nine physicochemical parameters within the lake: Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD, mg L-1), Ammonia (NH3, mg L-1), Chloride (Cl, mg L-1), Nitrate (NO3, mg L-1), Inorganic Phosphate (PO4, mg L-1), Total Nitrogen (TN, mg L-1), Total Phosphorus (TP, mg L-1), Turbidity (Turb, NTU), and Chlorophyll a (Chl a, μg L-1). Trends were analyzed using data from 2000 to 2012 in five selected stations spread out across the lake. The Trophic State Index (TSI) values of the stations within the study period were also derived from TP, TN, Chl a, and the average of the three parameters. In terms of temporal analysis, general trends, relative monthly values (MV), percent annual changes (PAC) of the nine parameters and their derived TSI values were assessed and analyzed. Spatial trends were assessed by calculating the relative station values (RV) and their standard deviations (SV), principal component analysis (PCA), and hierarchical agglomerated cluster analysis (HACA). BOD and Chl-a have shown statistical growth over the period of 12 years while Cl revealed a consistent decrease in concentration. Moreover, results also showed that Stations 1 and V located at West Bay is the most polluted of all five stations studied, most likely because of its proximity with the highly urbanized and densely populated National Capital Region. This was further supported by HACA results, wherein the two have overwhelmingly similar trends in terms of nutrient and pollutant loadings. Lastly, PCA results revealed that the lake’s current condition can be attributed to BOD, TP, and Chl-a.

Results from the western and eastern regions of the lake, characterized by marked differences in water qualities, indicate that linear shell characteristics are not significantly affected by water quality, in contrast to other geometric parameters. Geometric morphometrics of Malahanobis and Procrustes distances exhibit horizontal elongation in shells from the west, and vertical elongation in those from the east. Generalized linear mixed modelling of shell morphometry with water quality revealed an inverse relationship between NO3- and shell size, and a direct association between shell shape changes and elevated Cr (VI). The combination of NO3-, water pH and total suspended solids were the factors identified to have the most effect on shell size, with Cr (VI), NH4+, and water pressure playing significant roles in affecting shape.

This study attempted to examine the flood vulnerability among households in 14 districts of the delta. The analysis helped identify communities that were subjected to floods and needed more attention in disaster management. People in the MRD had remarkably low exposure, which was the result of investment in water structures. About 59.2 % of the surveyed households were moderately vulnerable to flooding. Families in O Mon, Thanh Binh, Cai Be, and Cho Lach district had the highest vulnerability indices. The most significant indicators to explain the flood-prone state were rice-related indicators, elderly dependency ratios, and social capital.

An increased removal capability was observed when the best isolate was applied ina semi-continuous treatment system thru an Aerobic Cascading Filter Bed BaffledReactor (ACFBBR). The reactor design including the packing material remarkably enhanced the contact between the yeast biomass and Pb contaminated wastewaterresulting in a much greater biosorption capacity of 170.14 mg g-1 as compared to the biosorption of 56.7 mg g-1 achieved during the batch adsorption experiment.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/JESAM/article/view/92','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Carmel  Gacho, Fe  Coronado, Myra  Tansengco, Joven Barcelo, Cynthia Borromeo, Bernard Jude  Gutierrez','metal resistant, yeast isolate, abandoned mine site, Itogon Benguet, ACFBBR',NULL,15,5,4,'University of the Philippines Los Baños',3,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(107,'2021-07-29 13:11:26','2021-07-29 13:11:26','Using the Responses of Green Algae Spirogyra as Bioindicator for Metals and Pesticides Pollution','2019-09-25','Journal of Economics, Management and Agricultural Development Vol 21 No 2 (2018) Metals and pesticides are common environmental pollutants.

In this study, the responses of Spirogyra in the form of changes in chlorophyll content due to the exposure to these pollutants were reported. The algae was collected from natural environment, immobilized with agarose gel, and then being exposed to lead (Pb), aluminium (Al), calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), atrazine and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). The changes of chlorophyll in the algae were measured for 48 hours using a spectrophotometer at 663 nm and 450 nm respectively. The content of the pigment was changed due to the presence of the pollutants at concentrations of 0.001 mg L-1 to 1.000 mg L-1. The change might due to the biochemical reactions triggered by the pollutants.

This study compared the adaptive capacity to climate risks of organic and conventional vegetable farmers in La Trinidad, Benguet in the Philippines. Guided by the Sustainable Livelihoods framework, thirty variables under the five livelihood capitals were used to compute Household Adaptive Capacity Index (HACI). Organic farming households have higher adaptive capacity than the conventional group, and have higher natural, financial, human, and social capital. The higher adaptive capacity of organic farmers was due to farm practices related to organic agriculture such as crop diversification, sustainable land management, and participation in organizations. This indicated that organic farming potentially enhances adaptive capacity of vegetable farming households. Findings support literature on the contribution of organic farming to the resilience of agricultural systems.

More than 50% of husbands solely made decisions on choice of food crops, cash crops, tree species, and farm production. This parallel findings in the Philippines showing male dominance in agricultural production. Nevertheless, women still participated in decision-making in a limited way as 13-16% of them singly decided on behalf of the household while 30-38% made decisions together with the husband.

It focused on the understanding/perception of the RBAS farmer respondents on climate change and their account of its influence on the production system and their coping mechanisms. Among the farmer respondents, drought (El Niño), typhoon, strong winds, heavy rains/excessive rainfall, flash floods and landslides are among the common evidences of climate change. Generally, most of the adaptation strategies employed is through cultural management practices like minimized usage of inorganic fertilizer and chemical pesticides from Agusan del Sur farmer respondents while some of the farmer respondents in North Cotabato employed organic farming practices to adapt to climate change. For both provinces, farmer respondents particularly identified agroforestry and diversified farming system as an effective adaptation strategy. Results proved the potential of the rubber-based agroforestry system to evolve as a resilient farming practice to adapt to climate change vis-à-vis stable biological and economic productivity, controlled occurrence of pest and diseases and minimized detrimental effects of climate change on the agroforestry farm component as a whole.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/JESAM/article/view/109','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Roselyn  Furoc-Paelmo, Russel Son  Cosico, Rowena Esperanza  Cabahug, Arnold Karl  Castillo, Arturo  Castillo, Roberto  Visco','climate change, resilience, rubber-based agroforestry, typology',NULL,15,5,4,'University of the Philippines Los Baños',3,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(123,'2021-07-29 13:11:26','2021-07-29 13:11:26','Factors Influencing Farmers’ Climate Change Adaptation in Northern Ghana: Evidence from Subsistence Farmers in Sissala West, Ghana','2019-10-09','Journal of Economics, Management and Agricultural Development Vol 21 No 1 (2018) Most African countries are vulnerable to climate change as a result of poverty, weather extremes, and insufficient governmental agricultural support. Using the area of Sissala West District, factors influencing farmers’ adaptation to climate change and strategies used to avert climate change impact were determined. A total of 330 small-scale farmers were sampled and their views were determined Using logits regression model, weighted average index, and frequency table. Weighted average index was used to rank opinions of 150 key informants in focus group discussions. Using logits regression model, the study indicated irregular rainfall, high temperature, weather information, and high evaporation as the factors compelling farmers to adapt to climate change. Weighted Average Index used to measure weather extremes revealed that drought and temperature had the highest level of occurrence. Furthermore, climate change adaptation strategies assessed in the study showed that agroforestry practices, drought-resistant crops, and mulching were the most preferred methods. The study concluded that farmers’ ability to adapt to climate change can be improved if Environmental Protection Agency and Ministry of Food and Agriculture intensify climate adaptation campaigns, increase access to weather information, and training farmers on adaptable strategies including, but not limited to, alternative sources of livelihood.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/JESAM/article/view/110','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Clifford James  Fagariba, Shaoxian  Song, Serge  Soule','Adaptation, Agriculture, Perceived Effects, Strategies',NULL,15,5,4,'University of the Philippines Los Baños',3,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(124,'2021-07-29 13:11:26','2021-07-29 13:11:26','Spectrochemical Analysis of Tissues of Frog Dryophytes plicatus Tadpoles (Amphibia: Hylidae) Developing under Lead and Iron Pollution','2019-10-09','Journal of Economics, Management and Agricultural Development Vol 21 No 1 (2018) This study conducted a bioassay on frog tadpoles of the Mexican endemic species Dryophytes plicatus exposed to lead and iron. This species was used because some of its populations live near urban areas that may exposed them to pollutants, such as heavy metals due to industrial processes or mining industry. Specimens in a post-embryonic stage of Dryophytes plicatus were collected in water bodies near El Chico National Park. For the bioassay, the collected samples were grouped into three namely; tadpoles in contact with steel cloves (99% Fe, 1% C); the second group in contact with lead plates; and the last was the control group (without heavy metals). A spectrochemical analysis was held to identify the concentrations of these elements in the liver, intestines, and gills. This study shows that Dryophytes plicatus can bioaccumulate these heavy metals in their tissues, particularly in the liver and the intestine. The concentration of lead and iron was similar in both the control and experimental groups, due to the use of tap water of a mining place, but the concentration in the tadpoles tissues indicates a bioaccumulation process.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/JESAM/article/view/111','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','David Ramiro  Aguillón-Gutiérrez, Aurelio  Ramírez-Bautista, Claudia  Romo-Gómez','Dryophytes plicatus, tadpoles, amphibian, lead, iron',NULL,15,5,4,'University of the Philippines Los Baños',3,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(125,'2021-07-29 13:11:26','2021-07-29 13:11:26','Comparative Assessment of Different Methods in Generating Design Storm Hyetographs for the Philippines','2019-10-09','Journal of Economics, Management and Agricultural Development Vol 21 No 1 (2018) Design storm hyetographs are synthetic temporal rainfall patterns used as input for flood modeling studies, drainage design and hydrodynamic modeling.

In this study, six other methods- AB from actual RIDF curve, actual normalized 24-hour storms and four different patterns derived by Huff (1967)- were tested using the tipping-bucket raingauge records of a local weather station. Nonparametric statistical tests were employed to determine the significant difference between and among distributions. Moreover, Chi-squared goodness-of-fit test was used to compare the hyetographs with data from actual storms. The PAGASA AB hyetographs, while accurate in some instances, do not always represent actual storms well. Furthermore, other methods may have better fits for other storms.

It was found that finer fractions of PM have greater negative effect on visibility. This inverse relationship was pronounced during winter season, having the highest PM2.5 concentrations and the lowest visual range. Summer season exhibited the highest visual range and least PM2.5 fractions, along with autumn. Furthermore, lower relative humidity coincides with higher visual range regardless of the PM fractions. As the levels of relative humidity went up (>90%), lower values of visual range were measured.

The mean VEP for a per capita monthly poverty threshold of US$1.25 is 37%, 41% for US$1.5 and 46% for US$2.0. Among the different sectors, those dependent on aquaculture/fishery had the highest incidence of vulnerability followed by those dependent on employment in the manufacturing sector. In terms of geographical location, households in the coastal areas were found to have the highest incidence, followed by those in the lowland and lastly those in the midland to highland areas.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/JESAM/article/view/151','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Jaimie Kim  Arias, Rowena Dorado, Maria Emilinda  Mendoza, Vicente  Ballaran, Jr., Hazel  Maligaya','Climate Change, Laguna, Vulnerability',NULL,15,5,4,'University of the Philippines Los Baños',3,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(163,'2021-07-29 13:11:26','2021-07-29 13:11:26','Institutional Arrangements in Mangrove Rehabilitation Management of Palaui Island Protected Landscape and Seascape (PIPLS), Sta.

This paper aimed to present the case of Protected Area Management Board (PAMB) of Palaui Island Protected Landscape and Seascape (PIPLS) in terms of stakeholder’s role, interaction, and efforts to address problems and issues on mangrove management. Key informant interviews (KII’s) in 14 institutions using a structured questionnaire were employed. The responses were validated in the field through community interview using unstructured questions.  Stakeholder analysis was used to analyze the result of the interview. The interaction is only apparent among some stakeholders as far as mangrove management is concerned. Strong interaction was observed among some stakeholders while others have weak or no interaction. Stakeholders with weak interaction are those who do not have the jurisdiction on the resource while those with no interaction are stakeholders with no defined roles  on mangrove management. Strong interaction was observed among stakeholders whose mandate is in line with the protection of the resource and has clear roles. Problems on the enforcement (i.e. lack of manpower and resources, inaccessibility of the administering authority, and overlapping institutional roles) still persist but coordination, consultation, and collaboration are being exercised by PAMB members to prevent further confusion and successfully manage the resource. However, the weak implementation of laws due to humanitarian reasons may hamper the effectiveness of enforcement which eventually affects the successful and sound management of mangroves. Therefore, these problems should be immediately addressed. The functions of the members were only stated during the survey and interview and these shall still be subjected to further analysis to come up with a more organized and systematic development of mangrove management in PIPLS.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/JESAM/article/view/152','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Melanie  Calicdan, Carmelita Rebancos, Nestor Baguinon','institutional arrangement, stakeholders’ analysis, mangrove rehabilitation',NULL,15,5,4,'University of the Philippines Los Baños',3,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(164,'2021-07-29 13:11:26','2021-07-29 13:11:26','Screening and Identification of Plants at a Petroleum Contaminated Site in Malaysia For Phytoremediation','2019-11-14','Journal of Economics, Management and Agricultural Development Vol 19 No 1 (2016) There is lack of sufficient data that describe which plants can be used in phytoremediation for petroleum and heavy metal contaminated sites, especially in the tropical climate region.

Good agreement was obtained between simulated and observed streamflow values during model calibration (NSE=0.84 & R2=0.86), and validation (NSE=0.61 & R2=0.68). For the entire watershed, reduction in forest cover and rangeland resulted to an increase in surface runoff and decreases in baseflow or dry season flow and groundwater recharge. LULC changes affected the water quantity and timing of occurrence. Subbasin with 22% increase in forest cover and rangeland increased the baseflow by 1% to 15% and reduced the streamflow by 1% to 17% during the rainy months. Another subbasin with 54% forest loss resulted to more pronounced rainfall-runoff response with 11% to 17% decrease in baseflow and 4% to 24% increase in streamflow during rainy months.

Fish samples comprised of juvenile fish from 12 species, including four that were introduced. These non-native species were more abundant than native fish caught. Dietary analyses suggest that non-native fish have a wider dietary breadth compared to native fish and may be one reason why introduced fish populations have exceeded native fish populations in the area. Fish activity varied depending on time of day in certain sub-sites and these fishes aggregated in intermittent deep pools when water depth is uniformly low in the river during  the dry season. These suggest that fish abundance in the area is associated with river water depth and other environmental factors.

Typhoons in the region usually originate from the mid-Pacific region that includes the Warm Pool, which is regarded as the warmest ocean surface region globally. Two study areas were considered: one in the Warm Pool Region and the other in the West Pacific Region near the Philippines. Among the most important factors that affect the strength of a typhoon are sea surface temperature (SST) and water vapor. It is remarkable that in November 2013 the average SST in the Warm Pool Region was the highest observed during the 1981 to 2014 period while that of the West Pacific Region was among the highest as well. Moreover, the increasing trend in SST was around 0.20ºC per decade in the warm pool region and even higher at 0.23ºC per decade in the West Pacific region. The yearly minimum SST has also been increasing suggesting that the temperature of the ocean mixed layer is also increasing. Further analysis indicated that water vapor, clouds, winds and sea level pressure for the same period did not reveal strong signals associated with the 2013 event. The SST is shown to be well-correlated with wind strength of historically strong typhoons in the country and the observed trends in SST suggest that extremely destructive typhoons like Haiyan are likely to occur in the future.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/JESAM/article/view/175','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Josefino  Comiso, Gay Jane  Perez, Larry  Stock','Typhoon Haiyan, SST, Warm Pool',NULL,15,5,4,'University of the Philippines Los Baños',3,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(180,'2021-07-29 13:11:26','2021-07-29 13:11:26','Estimating the Recreational Value of Taal Volcano Protected Landscape, Philippines Using Benefit Transfer','2020-01-15','Journal of Economics, Management and Agricultural Development Vol 18 No 1 (2015) When protected landscapes serve as popular recreational resources and destinations, then they may hold significant use values for those people that visit them.

Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) was conducted to collect and synthesize indigenous knowledge and perceptions regarding environmental conditions and fishkills in Taal Lake. Specifically, this study aimed to document anecdotes on land- and lake-use changes through time, commodity shifts and utilization, technological flow, and environmental phenomena. The community’s perceptions on probable causes of fishkills were also elicited. Finally, the people’s view on the different internal and external factors linked to environmental management as well as their proposed solutions to problems were accounted and analyzed. The major trends and changes in natural resource utilization, urbanization, terrestrial and aquatic livelihood  activities, and occurrence of fishkill in the four municipalities in the past seven decades were illustrated using Timeline activity. Increase in human population is the major driver of changes in the natural resources of these municipalities. The local communities in the four municipalities depend on agricultural farming and fish–based activities in Taal Lake for their livelihood. The various factors involved in the occurrence of fishkill in Taal Lake could be categorized into environmental (climatic and volcanic) and anthropogenic factors. Oxygen depletion, volcanic activity, lake overturn, sudden changes in water color, seasonal changes, wind, hydrothermal vents, poor water quality, improper aquaculture practices, and  various forms of pollution-generating anthropogenic activities were cited to have influenced the occurrence of fishkills. The devastation brought by fishkill events prompted the community to formulate solutions based on experiences, knowledge of aquaculture industry, and the physical conditions of the lake. The cage operators, for instance, conduct oxygenation of fish cages when low dissolved oxygen (DO) is observed and during transfer of fish cages to other areas. In addition, efforts towards efficient aquaculture practices such as continuous reduction and systematic arrangement of fish cages in the respective zones, reduced stocking density and feeding rates in fish cages, and proper disposal and management of wastes from domestic, industrial and agricultural (poultry and piggery) sources are the suggested solutions to avoid fishkill.

Invertebrate remains and plant matter comprised the bulk of their diets based on the food items identified. The identified plant matter were leaves and seeds while invertebrates were easily identifiable through body parts such as legs, head and antennae. Other contents identified including vertebrate remains such as hair/fur, feathers and bones, plastics, rubber, stones, and intestinal worms were noted. Based on the calculated relative abundance of each food type, there is no significant difference in the diets of the three non-native rodent species. Preliminary results suggest that introduced rodents in Mt. Makiling have broad diets and there are no indications that their main diet includes native wildlife species.

The case of the municipality of Concepcion has also demonstrated that “onestop-shop” strategy of bringing the registration team to the people can increase fishers’ compliance. Some policy recommendations for the LGUs to improve its fisheries registration and licensing system include the following:  determine the carrying capacity of the resource as basis for limiting entry, standardize the registration and licensing procedure, establish a fair basis for license fees, and provide funds for the establishment and maintenance of a databank of fishers and the status of their registration and licensing.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/JESAM/article/view/189','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Ruby  Napata, Liberty Espectato, Genna  Serofia','licensing, registration, fisheries management',NULL,15,5,4,'University of the Philippines Los Baños',3,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(193,'2021-07-29 13:11:26','2021-07-29 13:11:26','Assessing Vulnerability to Climate Change Impacts in Cambodia, the Philippines and Vietnam: An Analysis at the Commune and Household Level','2020-01-17','Journal of Economics, Management and Agricultural Development Vol 17 No 2 (2014) The study takes on the framework that vulnerability to climate change depends on the interrelationship of key elements of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity (Adger, 2006). The general objective of the study is to arrive at an understanding of the community and household vulnerability in three study areas: Kampong Speu in Cambodia, Laguna province in the Philippines, and Thua Thien Hue in Vietnam. Specifically, it aims 1) to measure communes’/ barangays’ relative vulnerability in the selected study sites; 2) to analyze social vulnerability of local communities in terms of underlying problems; and, 3) to measure and explain the vulnerability of households in relation to their economic and demographic features. Community level and household level surveys were conducted to gather data for the vulnerability analysis, in combination with qualitative data gathering tools such as key informant and in-depth interviews and focused group discussions. About two thirds of communes/barangays in the studies sites were identified as highly vulnerable. These are mostly communities in lowland and coastal areas; especially communes/barangays with relatively high incidence of poverty, with large areas devoted for agricultural activitiesand with poor infrastructure facilities. On the other hand, household characteristics found to be related to vulnerability to climate-related risks and hazards include household income, types of livelihood, family size, education of the household head, and the level of exposure to identified hazards. Households living on natural resource-based livelihood are likely to be more vulnerable as these livelihoods are more exposed to and more sensitive to climate hazards.  Most poor households are found to be vulnerable. Low adaptive capacity was found to be a key determinant of household vulnerability to climate change across countries. Women were found to be more vulnerable to climatic hazard than men due to limitation in skills and opportunitiesbut they were given more responsibilities in taking care of family member during risk hazard response and rehabilitation periods.

Parameter estimations gave the model an efficiency of 0.93 for the entire event set. Mean fraction of rainfall to storm flow was 23.1%, ranging from 5.6 to 48.3%. Variations were also observed in rainfall contribution related mainly to antecedent moisture conditions and other hydrological properties of the catchment. Quick response flow that was estimated from the saturated overland flow in the model comprised 41.9 -75.9% of the total runoff for nine storm events, while base flow accounted for 41.7% of streamflow for all events. No significant relationship between rainfall amount and quick response flow was found. This study introduced a modeling approach to identify the source of streamflow on a forested catchment.

Total Kjeldahl N (TKN), total P (TP) and total organic C (TOC) were determined in both unfiltered (total) and filtered (< 1.2 μm) samples. The particulate fraction (> 1.2 μm, a conservative estimate) tended to dominate offsite transport of TKN, TP and TOC from agricultural land uses, especially in regions with more intense cropping systems, namely Pagsanjan and Lucban. The average proportions of particulate forms of N and P (PN and PP) were higher at Pagsanjan which is a rice growing area (73% of TKN and 68% of TP) than at Lucban (59% of TKN and 64 % of TP), which is generally under vegetable production. At Cavinti (a site under coconut production), particulate forms of TKN and TP were dominant while the soluble fraction dominated TOC transport. For the piggery site at Majayjay, particulate forms controlled the movement of TKN and TOC while the soluble form dominated TP transport. A significant, positive relationship was observed between total suspended solids (TSS) and PN and between TSS and POC at all sites. A significant relationship between TSS and TP was only noted at Lucban. Overall, the study showed that despite the conservative estimate (> 1.2 μm colloids only), particulate  forms for C, N and P were the dominant fraction from all land uses in these agricultural catchments, except P from the piggeries site.

The unique life history and importance of zooplankton in aquatic ecosystems, coupled with the capability of lakes to integrate changes in the surrounding watershed, has given each the recognition as “beacons and sentinels of climate change,” respectively. Aside from this, many lakes have undergone pollution through human-induced eutrophication attributed to extensive lake-shore town development, agricultural waste runoffs, and intensive aquaculture. Implementation of holistic lake management plans in many countries has resulted to the rehabilitation and even reversal of lake eutrophication, and this is, in part, due to regular monitoring and careful analysis of temporal zooplankton community data that came with implemented rehabilitation efforts. As such, monitoring lake zooplankton populations may give us clues as to how changes in the environment, either from human or climate induced changes have already affected lake ecosystems. It is unfortunate however, that such analysis is presently not available in our country due to lack of routine zooplankton monitoring programs.

The effect of the diversification treatment on the rhizosphere bacterial population, known to promote growth of host plant, was analyzed within a fifteen-month period (August 2007 to November 2008). The number of cultivable soil bacteria on-site prior to planting was very low (<0.01 to 2 x 103  CFU per g) owing to soil’s acidity (pH 5) and poorly nourished condition. Higher bacterial population was observed from Jatropha rhizosphere than soil without vegetation. Bacterial population also varied with diversification treatments. Highest populations (7.3 x 104  to 1.3 x 105  CFU per g) of Cu-, Pb- and Zn resistant bacteria were observed where in Jatropha was interplanted with Pterocarpus, Cassia, and Lagerstroemia. It appears that such treatment enhanced the population of heavy metal-resistant rhizosphere bacteria in Jatropha indicative of its potential in bioremediation. Randomly selected isolates were identified as Arthrobacter oxydans, Klebsiella variicola and Bacillus spp, which are all common soil bacteria. Rehabilitation of abandoned, mined-out areas can thus be naturally promoted by diversifying plants being introduced in such sites as this would enhance rhizosphere bacterial population.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/JESAM/article/view/262','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Arlene  Llamado, Asuncion  Raymundo, Nelly  Aggangan, Nelson  Pampolina, Nina  Cadiz','bioremediation, heavy metal-resistant bacteria, rhizosphere, Jatropha, interplanting',NULL,15,5,4,'University of the Philippines Los Baños',3,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(208,'2021-07-29 13:11:27','2021-07-29 13:11:27','Energy Savings and Carbon Emission Reduction of Smart Lighting Installation in a Multipurpose and Residential Building in Santiago de Compostela, Spain','2020-03-11','Journal of Economics, Management and Agricultural Development Vol 16 No 2 (2013) The excessive emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere has increased the global average temperature resulting to a phenomenon known as global warming.

Screenhouse experiments were conducted to determine the survival, growth and copper (Cu) accumulation of non-mycorrhizal or mycorrhizal J. curcas seedlings or cuttings grown in oven sterilized grassland soil from Caliraya, Laguna and in mine tailing soils from Paracale, Camarines Norte and Mogpog, Marinduque. Grassland soil was sterilized in an oven for three days at 100˚C prior to use. Seedlings or cuttings were either uninoculated or inoculated with Mykovam or MineVAM mycorrhizal inoculants. Results show that Paracale soil supported the highest survival and best growth of seedlings or cuttings. In Mogpog soil, all seedlings died before two months except those inoculated with Mykovam while all cuttings died on the third month. Non-mycorrhizal seedlings did not survive in Caliraya soil while mycorrhizal inoculation increased seedling survival and growth. Cuttings did not respond to inoculation, probably due to low  mycorrhizal infection (≤14 %) as compared to seedlings (≤100 %). Mykovam promoted higher survival and better plant growth than MineVAM because of its higher root colonization. Cu accumulation was higher in the roots of mycorrhizal plants and the lowest was in the leaves especially in the Mykovam-inoculated plants. In conclusion, Mykovam inoculated J. curcas grew better with higher survival rate than the control thus this imply that rehabilitation of grasslands in Caliraya, Laguna and mine tailing areas in Paracale, Camarines Norte can be done for its potential for biofuel production.

The CPCs, which are estimated from regression models and represented in a diagram as contour plots, are a spatiotemporal vulnerability yardstick that estimates vulnerability levels and thresholds to the combined impacts of environmental stress and human susceptibility (or lack of adaptive capacity). As compared to the CPCs for Russia, those for India and Portugal tilt more towards the water stress axis. This implies that the level of vulnerability in the latter countries tends to be more sensitive to the changes in water stress level than socio-economic susceptibility. For a particular water stress level, however, the probability of crisis occurring in India is higher than in Portugal. India has thus the lowest vulnerability threshold. Using pooled and panel regression, the information for three case study regions was combined to develop a common measure of vulnerability thresholds. Building common or generic thresholds will allow comparison of vulnerability across regions, which can be useful for policy in terms of developing priority list for providing adaptation support in vulnerable regions. However, the results revealed that there is a risk of under- or overestimating vulnerability thresholds when comparing regions not only with different level, but also varying sources of vulnerability. Thus, more crucial than developing generic vulnerability thresholds is highlighting differential vulnerability through selection of appropriate susceptibility indicators.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/JESAM/article/view/299','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Lilibeth Acosta, Fausto Galli','Vulnerability, Adaptive Capacity, Drought, Climate Change, Susceptibility, Binary choice model',NULL,15,5,4,'University of the Philippines Los Baños',3,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(215,'2021-07-29 13:11:27','2021-07-29 13:11:27','The Profitability of Environmental Proactivity in Business Education Institutions: an Investigation of University Administrators','2020-04-29','Journal of Economics, Management and Agricultural Development Vol 16 No 1 (2013) Abstract not available.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/JESAM/article/view/301','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Blanca Delgado-Marquez, J.

Calavite Wildlife Sanctuary (MCWS) is regarded as home to more than a hundred species of plants, but its floristic composition, vegetation structure, and diversity pattern remained unclear since its declaration as a protected area. After the recent plant diversity assessment conducted following the prescribed methodology by the DENR–Biodiversity Management Bureau, the conservation value of the mountain was emphasized. This paper provides a concrete evidence that MCWS is home to diverse yet unique species of plants. A total of 181 morpho–species belonging to 67 families were recorded. MCWS now holds a large number of species of at least 250 morpho–species based on the assessment and gathered secondary data. Thirty–three (33) are threatened and forty–six (46) species are endemic to the Philippines. Four (4) species are known to occur only in MCWS, namely – Ardisia calavitensis Merr., Peristrophe cordatibractea Merr., Urophyllum mindorense Merr., and Cyrtochloa mindorensis S. Dranf. Majority of the species (about 67%) recorded are non–endemic indigenous. Dominant species in MCWS from 200 masl to 600 masl were also revealed. Mostly are species belonging to Fabaceae, Lauraceae, Malvaceae, Moraceae, Myrtaceae, Phyllanthaceae, Rubiaceae, Sapindaceae, and Sterculiaceae. MCWS, being comprised of a mosaic of different vegetation from grassland to secondary forest, has generally a stunted vegetation due to harsh environmental condition. The stratum of the forest of MCWS is unique because some species were recorded to a particular forest layer, allowing other species to coexist. Plant diversity pattern of MCWS showed weak correlation to elevation. The need to protect the mountain is further supported by the computed Shannon index (H =4.41) that indicates very high diversity.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/EDJ/article/view/239','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Pastor L.

The species composition and structural complexity of urban greenspaces influence the ecosystem services it can provide, and ability to adapt to environmental stresses. Hence, this study was conducted to understand how urban greenspaces were shaped by the different land uses associated to management. Fourteen urban greenspaces in the vicinity of Metropolitan Manila were selected and classified into three types – commercial greenspaces, recreational parks, and wildlife parks. These were compared based on tree species composition and diversity metrics estimated using species identification and abundance data. Tree measurement data were also used to compare the structural patterns of trees in different types of urban greenspace. Results of chi-square tests (α=0.05) showed that the proportion of native and exotic tree species and the relative abundance of threatened and non-threatened trees in both local and global scales were significantly associated with the type of urban greenspace. Significant associations also existed between the type of urban greenspace and the distribution of trees into diameter, height, and crown spread classes. Species diversity metrics and tree measurements were also significantly different across the three types of urban greenspace based on Kruskal-Wallis Test and Dunn’s Multiple Pairwise Comparison.

To aid disaster risk plans and management in the future, change in land cover was determined using multi–temporal analysis. This study determined the repercussions and effects of land cover change and its possible consequences based on the disaster that happened in 2004 and the socio–economic characteristics of the area. With the purpose of assessing the changes in land cover that occurred during the periods 1994–2004 and 2004– 2014, a methodology using a multifunctional Semi–Automatic Classification Plugin was used in the Quantum GIS software. Cross tabulation matrix analysis was used to distinguish those changes as a result of the transition. There was a 15.45% loss of primary forest and 15.26% gain of secondary forest and brushland from 1994–2014. Increase in built–up areas was also observed from 1994–2004 due to urban sprawl, but after the tragedy, a decrease in built–up areas was revealed due to washing away of properties in the locality.

Generally focusing on the institutional mechanisms for resettlement, the study aimed to discuss the resettlers’ knowledge on resettlement, assess the resettlement process as implemented by the THXP, and determine the outcomes of resettlement on the household capitals. Data gathering methods were household survey, focus group discussion, key informant interviews, and review of secondary data. Eighty–four randomly chosen household heads served as respondents of the study. Descriptive and inferential statistics using t–test were employed in the data analysis. Results revealed that the households are very satisfied in the resettlement area for having access to school facilities, water, electricity, and roads. However, they were dissatisfied with the availability of job opportunities in the resettlement sites. The communities have knowledge on agricultural production, food security or poverty reduction, and livelihood changes. The THXP’s resettlement strategies considered gender equality, community participation, and culture. Results of the t–test show that resettlement has significant effects on the households’ capital assets. It has improved their physical capital but decreased primarily their natural, human, and social capitals.

Malarayat Brgy. Malitlit, Lipa City, Batangas','2019-10-17','Ecosystems and Development Journal Vol 8 No 1 (2018): Ecosystems and Development Journal Mountain ecosystem assessments are usually based on species or taxonomic groups, structural characters of forest ecosystems and/or biodiversity indicatorsderived from taxonomic variables. Amidst advanced science tools for speciesdiversity studies, forest biodiversity data in the light of ecology and taxonomy forpromoting conservation and enhancing biodiversity management especially in urban and urbanizing areas, are few. In Mt. Malarayat, Brgy. Malitlit, Lipa City,Batangas, a rapid plant diversity survey was conducted to provide the needed biodiversityinformation. An approximately 2.3 km BMS transect was established and all plant species were identified within the 10–meter width (5 meters from each side of thetrail). Height and diameter of trees with diameter of not less than10 cm were measured. Additional transect surveys, as wellas opportunistic approach, were conducted on other forested areas to accountfor other species outside the BMS. A total of 264 morpho–species, belonging to the seed plants (angiosperms and gymnosperms), ferns and their allies were recorded from the area. Results of the rapid plant survey revealed that Mt. Malarayat has high biodiversity value. Despite the limited survey time and efforts, the study also revealed that Mt. Malarayat is still home to a significant number of threatened, endemic, and indigenous forest tree speciesthat could contribute to overall health and balance of the city environment.The City’s effort to strengthen conservation and management of these precious resources is the key to biodiversity resilience in a city environment.

However, carbon sequestration studies in the Philippines generally used generic mixed species models; thus, this study was conceptualized – to generate a more accurate and direct estimate of the aboveground carbon and organic matter content of Benguet pine (Pinus kesiya). A total of 24 best–fit allometric models were generated for total aboveground carbon and organic matter content and its different compartments based on 15 destructively sampled trees. These models have high r2 and adjusted r2 values of 0.79 to 0.99 and are thus deemed highly accurate in estimating the carbon stock and, subsequently, the carbon sequestered by Benguet pine forest. Diameter at breast height (D) was found to be the primary predictor variable and total tree height (H) as the secondary predictor variable. Tree biomass was also characterized in terms of biomass partitioning pattern, wood–bark proportion and organic matter content. The main trunk contains the bulk (60 to 77%) of the aboveground biomass, followed by branches, needles and twigs, respectively. However, in small pines, needles have greater biomass than the branches. Larger pines generally have greater wood proportion than smaller trees while the bark is greatest on the basal portion and decreases apically in trunk sections. High OM ranging from 72 to 99% were recorded in the different components with higher percentages in woody components than in needles and bark; and in smaller pines than in larger ones. Having these species–specific allometric models and a clear understanding on biomass and carbon distribution in Benguet pine could help local forest managers accurately account for pine forest carbon stock and guide them on how to enhance the pine tree’s carbon sequestration capacity.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/EDJ/article/view/236','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Jones T.

Amidst its importance as a requisite for empirical–based strategies for adaptation from the impacts of climate change, applicability of vulnerability assessment models however must be tested across the varying regional conditions of systems before their wide usage. The study was conducted to assess the level of vulnerability of the Irawan watershed in Puerto Princesa City, Philippines due to climate change using the GeoREVIEW model. Secondary data were used for each indicator except for the soil. Soil data were obtained through field sampling. Weights of indicators were determined through pairwise comparisons. All the indicators under the three components of vulnerability were characterized except for the biomass potential due to the absence of forest inventory data of varying periods. Values for each indicator of vulnerability were generated and their equivalent vulnerability scales ranging from 1 to 5 were determined. Ten (10) thematic maps were generated with a 30 m x 30 m resolution. Indicators representing the biological components of the watershed had the highest weight while climatic indicators were rated as the lowest. The overall vulnerability map generated a scale ranging from 1.90 to 2.99 placing the watershed at a moderately vulnerable level within its varying regions with an overall vulnerability point to climate change and anthropogenic hazards of 48.96.

The time for a forest to be restored depends on productivity of the tree species and treatments applied during the planting process. Throughout the forest restoration period, planted tree species growth may either positively or negatively affect the soil condition. Thus, it is essential to study the relationship between the changes in soil properties and growth rate of trees at different ontogenetic phases in a rehabilitated forest. Observation on D. beccarii showed tree height growth rate increasing rapidly at the early stage, followed by apparent bulking up in stem diameter in 9–year–old stand. The higher tree density in 14–year–old stand contributes to high LAI value. The expansion of canopy size was rapid in 20–year–old stand. Tree height showed sigmoid growth pattern, while growth rate of stem diameter, canopy size, and LAI were still constantly increasing up to 20 years. The soil pH level in all tree stands became less acidic while bulk density and soil moisture content were decreased as the tree age increased. Except for exchangeable Mg and Ca, significant reduction (P<0.05) in soil total N, available P, and exchangeable K were observed in the older stands.

Using Shannon–Weiner Index, plant diversity was evaluated through field surveys of farms with input support and without input support, and was compared if there was a difference. Individual analysis was done in five nested plots, i.e., 20 x 20m plot as perennial, 4 x 4m plot as intermediates, and 1 x 1m plot as underbrush. Plant diversity in areas with input support was consistently higher than in areas without input support. Productivity and tenurial security were evaluated based on the results of a survey of 52 farmers, with 37 farmers under the “with input support” and 15 farmers under the “without input support”. For productivity, the group of respondents with farms that received input support had a higher average net present value (NPV) at 12% discount rate of PhP 328,582 ha–1, compared to the group without input support that had an NPV of PhP 185,682 ha–1.

It has been recognized that tropical forests have the greatest potential for mitigating climate change due to its high capacity to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. In the Philippines, Kalahan Forest Reserve (KFR), located in cluster 1 of Ikalahan– Kalanguya Ancestral Domain, provinces of Nueva Vizcaya and Pangasinan is one of the areas that can serve as sink of carbon. To determine the amount of carbon that can be potentially stored in the forestlands of KFR, eight transects (two transects each in mossy and Pinus kesiya forests; four transects in secondary forests) were established. In each transect, 10 sample plots measuring 100 m2 were established. Trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 5 cm inside the sample plots were measured and their species name noted. Biomass of trees and roots were determined using appropriate allometric equations. Biomass densities were converted to equivalent carbon by multiplying them by 45%average value for the Philippines. Results of the assessment show that biomass and carbon densities of the three forest communities are in the following order: Pinus kesiya > secondary > mossy. More than 80% of the biomass is contributed by the trees while the remaining portion comes from the roots. Using the carbon density values derived, forestlands of KFR with an area of 5,087 ha holds a total of 457,698.79 mg of carbon.

However, land conversion at the expense of natural ecosystems has resulted to steady changes of carbon storage in the country which have not been fully quantified. Integrated ecosystem services value mapping has tremendous potential to aid policy and decision makers by incorporating carbon storage and sequestration values in the decision–making process. This would allow them to make more objective decisions involving land conversion based on the aggregate values and the economic trade–offs between the various allocations of natural ecosystems and agroecosystems which would not have been considered otherwise. Changes in agriculture, forestry, and other land uses in the Philippines from the years 2003 to 2010 have resulted to a decrease in carbon stock in the country’s AFOLU sector. Using the InVEST Carbon Storage and Sequestration model, the mean estimate for the total carbon lost from aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, soil organic matter, and detritus carbon pools due to spatial changes in the AFOLU sector is 246.4 Tg C. The mean estimated value of the carbon lost and emitted into the atmosphere is around PhP 311.1 billon using the market price of carbon, PhP 1,017.4 billion using the average social cost of carbon at 3% discount rate, and PhP 3,026.8 billion for the 95th percentile social cost of carbon at 3% discount rate.

CFV is a modality for transformation of traditional upland farming systems into sustainable farming systems that will address upland environmental degradation and improve farmers’ socio–economic conditions. The project adopted a community–based participatory approach to development, promotion and utilization of water and soil conservation agricultural practices; and a multi–level technology promotion mechanism to capacitate local extension/change agents. Research methods included gathering secondary data, farmer volunteer interviews, and a final field reconnaissance. After the CFV implementation, at least some of the farmer volunteers had taken up all but two of the thirteen introduced agricultural practices, and had adopted four new practices in particular: contour hedgerows, elimination of inorganic inputs, mulching and composting. Results showed that there was an average increase in farm income of 143%; this was backed up by the farmers’ scores for farm income before and after CFV, which showed a significant increase from ‘low’ to ‘moderate’. This increase in income was probably due to increased crop diversity and yields as a result of contour farming and intercropping; and reduced costs for chemical inputs due to adoption of mulching and composting. The skills and knowledge of the FVs about environmental issues also significantly improved based on Wilcoxon signed rank test while the attitude towards CFV based on Likert scale showed that the farmers were convinced of the benefits brought by the new practices learned through the project.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/EDJ/article/view/235','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Jerika-Mae C.

Significant constraints have included legal, governance, institutional, management capacities and financial aspects. In sharp contrast, the Philippines has over three decades of experience tackling the institutional mechanics of collaborative management. This paper analyzes the management arrangements of Mount Kitanglad Range Natural Park (MKRNP), one of the country’s best collaboratively managed protected areas. The analysis reveals a multi-level collaborative management system, involving two landscape collaborative management bodies, 13 protected area management working groups and the resurrection of local indigenous institutional bodies - the Council of Elders and the tribal guards. Some protected area working groups are effective whilst a few working groups have broad, and sometimes overlapping, mandates. Of high concern, both the landscape collaborative management bodies have low representation of these working groups and the indigenous communities themselves.

The issue of food security is very relevant among the local people in the villages who have been affected by changes in government policies on shifting cultivation and poppy cultivation. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data obtained from 122 farmers as survey respondents and 30 farmers (five farmers per village) as focus group discussion (FGD) participants. Correlation analysis was done to determine the relationship between socio-demographic and economic characteristics of respondents and their household and community practices on food security, and household and community level farming practices and food security. Key informant interviews were conducted with six village and two district officials. To attain food security at the household level, the respondents plant upland rice using native varieties and use manual tools, raise swine and poultry in the traditional way, decline taking out loans, and practice equal sharing of farming and household tasks between husband and wife. At the community level, they availed of food distribution and livelihood programs in the past, both of which are scarce at present. Correlation analysis shows that household level farming practices on food security are positively related to educational attainment, total household income and length of stay in the area. Farmers who have higher educational attainment, higher total household income, and have stayed longer in the village resort to household level practices such as planting a variety of wetland rice, use higher seeding rate, raise livestock, and avail of credit. Community level practices are likewise positively correlated with the respondents’ age, length of stay in the area, and household size. Older farmers who have bigger household size and have stayed longer in the village access food and livelihood programs for food security.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/EDJ/article/view/225','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Anongsack Chanthavong, Josefina T.

Malindang Range Natural Park (MMNRP) that supplies water to Oroquieta City and nearby towns. Over the years, different anthropogenic activities, together with changing global climate, negatively affected the park. Studies show that the water produced by the watershed has been decreasing, while the demand for water is increasing. Thus, there is a need to conserve and protect the Layawan Watershed to prevent further degradation and ensure the sustainable production of ecosystem services. This paper analyzed willingness of upland communities to participate in the Layawan Watershed Conservation and Management Program (LWCMP). A contingent valuation survey involving 110 respondents from six upland barangays of Oroquieta City was conducted to evaluate: the respondents’ awareness about and perceptions towards the conservation and protection of the Layawan Watershed, their openness to and opportunity costs that would be incurred if they would adopt new conservation techniques, and their willingness to accept (WTA) compensation. The results of the study show that 99% of the respondents are willing to participate in the LWCMP despite the fact that their land will be subjected to a permanent conservation easement. In general, the Subanen tribe had a positive perception and feelings towards the different statements provided in the survey. They agreed on most of the statements and have identified provision of fresh water for drinking, domestic, agricultural and industrial uses as an important watershed service (90%). The total average willingness to accept compensation revealed in the survey (PhP 3,050/month) is higher by 56% compared to the total average farm income (PhP 1,334/month). Furthermore, the WTA amount elicited is higher by 5% compared to the total average households’ income (PhP 2,887). The high level of willingness to participate in the conservation program presents great potential in implementing a Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) scheme in Layawan Watershed.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/EDJ/article/view/226','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Mae Belen C.

The terraces are found in four municipalities in the province of Ifugao in northern Philippines, and were inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1995. In 2001, however, they were placed under the World Heritage in Danger List in 2001 owing to their deterioration. A contingent valuation survey was conducted among local (300 respondents) and foreign (250 respondents) tourists. Non-parametric (Turnbull) and parametric (Logit Regression) estimation were used to compute for their WTP to conserve the terraces. The estimated average WTP per visit for local and foreign tourists were PhP 440 (about USD 10) and PhP 3,124 (USD 71), respectively. These WTP estimates are much higher than the uniform fees collected by the municipalities from local and foreign tourists (about USD 0.20 and USD 0.60). For local tourists, the significant factors affecting WTP are gender (male), knowledge about the present condition of the terraces, and the bid amount, while for foreign tourists these are age, knowledge of UNESCO World Heritage Site status, and the bid amount. Adopting fees that are about 25% higher than the average WTP of local and foreign tourists can generate revenues that can cover about 20% of the cost requirement of implementing the master plan for the terraces. The contribution of tourism revenue can increase if higher fees will be collected, as the estimated average WTP for local and foreign tourists are much higher. Increasing the visitation rate can also have a positive effect on revenue, although this should consider the carrying capacity of the terraces so as not to compromise their integrity.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/EDJ/article/view/227','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Margaret M.

The ACWG protocol underwent conceptualization and design processes. The conceptualization process began with the online search using a single, mixed or combination of key terms, such as, “natural resource management,”“adaptive,” “governance,” and “collaboration,” which consequently resulted to the evaluation of four models proposed by institutions based on some criteria. A model was reviewed on the bases: a) that it can be used as a tool to explore and explain factors and forces underpinning the development of a local specific water governance platform; b) of available descriptive activities per phase that canserve as guide in the conduct of a participatory action research; and c) that can be applied in a natural resource management setting. The processes involved in designing the ACWG are: a) review of the model structure and the elements or variables of the four models; b) categorization into four phases of similar-in-nature elements having the same purposes; and c) definition of protocol according topurposes, procedure, and some guidelines or recommendations. The guidelines are results of the implementation of the ACWG protocol in the Santa Cruz Watershed, Philippines.

It is a market-based, voluntary instrument introduced in the early 1990s to address mounting concerns related to deforestation in the tropics and improve forest management (Rametsteiner & Simula 2003). Forest certification includes two basic components, forest management certification and chain of custody (CoC) certification. Forest management certification is issued as proof that a forest management unit (FMU) is sustainably managed. CoC certification, on the other hand, is a comprehensive assessment on the whole chain of custody from the processing, manufacturing, storage to the final consumers, to verify the origin of the raw materials involved (Nussbaum and Simula 2005). This paper aims to present the policy proposals on the establishment of a Philippine forest certification system towards SFM developed by the Forestry Development Center, University of the Philippines Los Baños College of Forestry and Natural Resources (FDC, UPLB-CFNR) and the Forest Management Bureau, Department of Environment and Natural Resources (FMB-DENR). The paper discusses the forest certification policies, standards, accreditation process, and the draft Executive Order (EO) and Department Administrative Order (AO) to establish the forest certification system in the country. It also presents the potentials for forest certification as well as the challenges in implementing it.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/EDJ/article/view/229','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','P.C.

Since the movement and transport of soil particles are predominated by rainfall as its agent especially in the humid tropics, climate change can affect soil erosion process. For critical watersheds such as Makatipo Catchment which supplies water to downstream communities in the Municipality of Lucban, assessing potential impacts of climate change on soil erosion is very important. The study was conducted to model soil erosion in Makatipo Catchment using Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) as modified by David (1998). Biophysical parameters, as input to USLE, were collected and analyzed using GIS. A2 and B2 climate scenarios from Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM2) were downscaled using SDSM 4.2 and used as inputs for soil loss assessment.Projections using scenarios showed that soil loss in the study area could increase during the next decades due to climate change. A2 projected an average increase of 33.32% from present (1981–2010) estimated soil loss of 17.06 t h-1 yr-1 while B2 projected a relatively lower increase of 9.73 t h-1 yr-1. Results also showed that areas experiencing high level or severe soil erosion would increase for both scenarios. The increase in soil erosion impairs water quality for various uses in downstream communities hence implementation of programs to rehabilitate erosion-prone areas, promote adoption of soil and water conservation strategies, and build climate resilient communities is highly recommended.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/EDJ/article/view/220','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Ronald C.

Hence, there is a need to identify them in urban areas like Makati City. The study aimed to identify and assess the TOF covered in urban areas and determine the extent of potential food sources. Google Earth Imagery was used to digitize the areas classified as “Other Lands” and assessed the TOF based on the Food and Agriculture Organization decision tree algorithm. Field assessment was done to identify the edible fruit-bearing trees and validate tree height in the TOF criteria. Following the GIS-based Assessment, Monitoring and Evaluation grid system, cells containing edible fruit-bearing TOF were marked. Results showed that the extent of cells with TOF as potential food source is scattered throughout the district. Most of the identified TOF are directly consumed by the communities. The assessment of TOF in urban areas can be used to account for the services they provide to the community. Planting of fruit-bearing trees and management of TOF in urban areas should be promoted to improve food access and security.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/EDJ/article/view/221','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Jan Joseph V.

The feasibility of the forestry carbon project was evaluated based on technical, financial, and social aspects. The results of the feasibility analysis reveal that developing a forestry carbon project for the Magbuku Ayta of Kanawan, Morong, Bataan is technically and financially feasible. The projected carbon loss in the ancestral domain due to the possible deforestation in the old growth forest is a lot higher than expanding second growth forests and brushlands, thus creating an excellent opportunity for the community to be engaged in a forestry carbon project. The NPV and IRR at the most conservative conditions (i.e., high scenario, price of USD 5t CO2-1, and 20% discount rate) are PhP70.728 million (about USD 1.61 million) and 27% respectively, which show that the forestry carbon project is financially viable.The Magbukun Ayta have also expressed in a resolution that they are amenable to the possibility of being involved in a PES project, specifically on the carbon sequestration potential of their forests, making the forestry carbon project socially acceptable. Likewise, the community\'s experience with implementing projects and contracts and benefit-sharing and conflict resolution mechanisms plact the community in an advantageous position to implement this project. Thus, the project is socially feasible and acceptable. It is therefore recommended tha the Magbukun Ayta engage in a forestry carbon project under the voluntary carbon market mechanisms.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/EDJ/article/view/215','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Margaret M.

The study used a purposivesurvey, which was complemented by secondary data review toassess the extent of private sector involvement in forestry activities.Simple descriptive statistics and time series analysis wereperformed.Tree farming in private lands is a thriving business among localpeople in Talacogon. There were 192 registered tree farmers in themunicipality holding private tree plantation ownership certificate(PTPOC) with a total land area of 914 ha in 2010. This businessgives a net income of USD 4,545 to 5,681 to farmers, and anaverage yield of 220 m3 ha–1 over a ten–year rotation. The outlookfor engaging in tree plantations is bright in the light of a number ofgovernment restrictions in harvesting timber from natural forests.These restrictions create a situation of timber scarcity that boostsconfidence in establishing tree plantation in private lands.Results showed that farmers could potentially get higher income inthe processing of timber into intermediate and final products.There is also potential of utilizing logging wastes (e.g. pulp andpaper production, wood manufactured articles, etc.), estimated tobe around 25–40% of gross volume produced. Thus to furtherimprove the tree farm industry situation, tree farmers suggestedthat government must provide financial assistance, encourageinvestment in strategic wood processing plants in the area, takemeasures to stabilize tree price, work for the reduction of tax onland and harvested products, and lastly, improve and properlymaintain farm–to–market roads in the municipality.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/EDJ/article/view/214','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Antonio P.

This study was conducted to develop a landslide susceptibility map of the Pagsanjan–Lumban Watershed by integrating the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Geographic Information System (GIS).The study considered seven factors (elevation, slope, rainfall,soil texture, land cover, fault lines and roads) in generating thesusceptibility map. Results from AHP showed that experts fromvarious fields have different perspectives on the level of importance of factors that resulted to the variability in judgments. Among the different factors, slope (23.18%) and rainfall (21.50%) had the highest relative weights while road (8.70%) and elevation (6.61%) had the lowest relative weights. Based on the weighted overlay analysis, the Landslide Susceptibility Index (LSI) of the watershed was observedbetween 1.43 and 3.65.

Thehighest number of seedlings (65) was recorded at an altitude of480 masl while the highest number of trees and saplings (15)was recorded at an altitude of 370 masl. Sampling plots athigher elevation have less dense vegetation and therefore havemore space for light penetration which is favorable to thegrowth of T. calantas. Additionally, higher elevations are lessaccessible to people and are therefore less disturbed.T. calantas showed a low population in terms of frequency,abundance and dominance as compared with other species. Asa critically endangered species, this paper proposes to use theseparameters as bases for restoring the population of T. calantasin Mt. Makiling. Since it is important to conserve reproductivetrees in order to ensure continuous increase and perpetuity ofthe population, priorities will be given to those areas wheremother trees exist. Conservation efforts are recommended forplots with mother trees and containing the highest number ofseedlings.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/EDJ/article/view/217','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Leilani A.

Qualitative analysis of conflictmanagement strategies (CMS) employed by stakeholders in theIntegrated Forest Management Agreement (IFMA) area ofSUDECOR was done based on narratives taken from key informant interviews and the focus group discussion (FGD). The study participants were chosen through snowball sampling technique and were made to narrate their perceptions about problems in the area and their participation in addressing those problems. Narratives were broken down to individual statements that bear on a particular CMS (i.e. accommodating, avoiding, collaborating, competing, and compromising).Clustering of the statements showed the preponderance ofstakeholders’ actions that fall under the competing strategy.This reflects the presence of multiple and overlapping interests of different stakeholders in the site, including their desire to impose their will and dominate others who also have a stake in the area. Next in importance is the compromising strategy, followed by avoiding and collaborating strategies. No stakeholder was seen to employ accommodating strategy, which is suggestive of the lack of efforts among stakeholders to generate shared understanding and commitment towards a common objective. The conflicts among stakeholders in the IFMA area stand in the way to achieving progress in the locality. Early resolution of conflicts within the IFMA areabefore they escalate into unmanageable levels is a priority concern of SUDECOR and the government itself. The study also revealed that using a qualitative approach to analyzing CMS only applies at the micro–level. Use of other methods in analyzing CMS is suggested for macro–level conflict management situations.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/EDJ/article/view/219','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Peter Jerome B.

The study used the participatory three-dimensionalmodelling (P3DM) as a tool in community-based managementplanning. The tool served as guide in identifying land uses andthe management strategies to be used for the managementplanning. Community-based management plans were developedwith the vision of uplifting the Subanen’s status of living and atthe same time conserving and protecting the Layawanwatershed. However, the communities do not have sufficientmeans of livelihood to support their needs, and if this is allowedto continue, it can make them turn to extractive and possiblydestructive activities within the watershed. RecognizingSubanen’s important role in protecting the watershed andsecuring watershed services, there is a need to support theSubanen, possibly through a sustainable financing mechanismsuch as PES.Through P3DM, the communities were able to visualize theircurrent situation in a holistic way. They were able to appreciatethe connection between their livelihood and the surroundingenvironment, paving the way for their willingness to participatein a PES scheme as environmental services (ES) providers of theLayawan watershed. The communities recognized that theconservation and protection of the Layawan Watershed is alsoto their best interest because the area is not only a source ofnatural resources but also serves as their home and ancestraldomain.

Remote sensing, the measurement ofobject properties on Earth’s surface using data acquired fromaircraft and satellites, has revolutionized understanding ofdynamic environment. Researchers use remote sensing satellitesto provide repetitive coverage of the earth for studyinglandscape dynamics, phenological variations of vegetation andchange detection analysis. By using land satellite imageriesgenerated from remote sensing, the extent of change in landcover of Maasin Watershed Forest Reserve from 1993, 2001,and 2009 was analyzed.Land cover in MWFR was classified into forest, brush, grass,and bare areas. Results of the analysis revealed that land coverof the said watershed has not been very stable from 1993 to2009. Time change detection analysis through cross tabulationshowed evident changes from one class to another over theyears. The results of the study showed slight improvement in thestate of the forest of MWFR as evidenced by a net gain of10.19% in the forest cover for 16 years.

This was evident in the way they wear their clothes, build their houses, find their source of livelihood, practice their ancestral faith and their decision to stay or not in their respective communities. However, some adaptation strategies became maladaptation since they resorted to logging, charcoal making and use of insecticides in their farms. While the efforts of the local governments units (LGUs) are commendable, more is expected of them especially, in arresting these maladaptation practices.This is very important since these practices may lead to two possibilities. The Mangyan can either become resilient or vulnerable, depending on their future actions.

The results alsoindicated that the NGP personnel fertilized the soil even without prior soil fertility information. Likewise, result from the soilinformation-indicative relationship survey indicated that DENR staff place a higher value to soil chemical properties (soil pH;Nitrogen, Phosphorous, and Potassium content; and soil organic matter) over physical and biological characteristics.

Impacts of Forest Tenure Reform in the Philippines','2020-02-06','Ecosystems and Development Journal Vol 5 No 2 (2015): Ecosystems and Development Journal This paper examines the evolution of tenure reform in the Philippine forest lands over the last three decades which in principle hastransferred “bundles of rights” from the State to local communities. It analyzes the dynamics and impacts of tenure reform and theassociated policy and related changes in terms of livelihoods, income, forest condition, and equity (referred to as the LIFEindicators in this study) based on literature review and four case studies representing three different types of tenure instruments.Despite radical efforts to restructure forest management in favor of local communities, our analysis of tenure reform in forest landsin terms of the LIFE indicators shows that the anticipated positive impacts are yet to be fully realized on the ground. The issuanceof the different tenure instruments have benefited the government more by effectively recruiting local communities to take on forestmanagement and protection responsibilities – tasks which the government was expected to perform before the tenure reform tookplace. However, livelihood and income of forest communities have not significantly improved in most cases. The combined effectsof unstable policies and insecure use rights, over regulation and centralized issuance of resource use permit, inadequateinstitutional support system, poor market access and opportunities, and limited capacities at the local level prohibit genuine tenurereform from taking root.Instead of bundles of rights and their corresponding benefits, we argue that what have been devolved by the State so far are bundlesof responsibilities that put more weights to the already burdened communities. This situation thwarts the accrual of benefits to theupland poor and may impede the promotion of sustainable forest management in Community-Based Forest Management areas. Thepaper distilled specific lessons and recommendations to enhance the impacts of forest tenure reform on livelihood and equity andadvance sustainable forest management that has relevance to other tropical countries of similar situation.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/EDJ/article/view/256','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Juan M.

Significant differences were alsoobserved between morning (AM) and afternoon (PM) sap yields.PM yields were consistently higher, presumably becausephotosynthesis occurs at daytime.Trees differed widely in terms of tapping duration (range: 24 to604 days; mean: 150 days).

Various risks, ranging from habitat destruction,illegal logging, invasive alien species, pollution and others, continue to threaten the significant range of natural resources of the region, which are also being complicated by impacts from progressing climate change. Addressing these issues require a range ofconservation approaches, one of which is the establishment of the ASEAN Heritage Parks (AHPs) Programme. With the ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity (ACB) as Secretariat, the AHP Programme aims to strengthen the management and conservation of 33 AHPs, which have been selected to represent the typical and unique ecosystems and species of Southeast Asia. The paper provides insights into the projects and activities of the AHP Programme, and recommendations on how it can continue to facilitate stronger management and conservation of the ASEAN region’s exceptional biodiversity.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/EDJ/article/view/213','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Ecosystems and Development Journal; Monina T.

The carbon sequestration potential of oil palm has been recognized for several years but no study has been done in the country to assess the amount of carbon in its biomass. This paper presents the amount of carbon stored in different parts of Elaeis guineensis, commonly known as African oil palm in plantations with different ages. The carbon content of one plant each from oil palm plantation with ages two, five, six, seven, eight, and nine years, was assessed. Results indicate that among different parts, trunk with frond butts and the fronds stored the highest amount of carbon per plant. The data also indicate that the carbon content of oil palm leaves does not vary with plantation age. Moreover, calculations show that a nine-year old oil palm plantation in the Philippines could sequester 6.1 t ha-1 yr-1 of carbon, with an estimated carbon density of 55 t ha-1. Older oil palm plants contain more carbon than those that are relatively younger. The study’s findings could help policy and decision makers craft climate change mitigation policies and programs in the Philippines.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/EDJ/article/view/192','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Ecosystems and Development Journal; Florencia B.

The various uses and potentials of alibangbang as a local resource was determined through interviews, direct observations, and analysis of secondary information. Results of the study revealed that the low regeneration of alibangbang could be attributed to upland farming, pasture and grazing, and the gathering of alibangbang shoots and leaves, cogon grass, charcoal, and fuelwood in the area. High preference for alibangbang fuelwood and charcoal put pressure on the survival and growth of remaining patches in the area. Local people prefer to use the shoots of alibangbang as a food flavoring resulting in over harvesting and pruning that disturb the tree’s photosynthetic activity and inhibits growth. Escape fires from land clearing and kaingin as well as regular browsing and trampling of grazing animals further affected the species’ capacity for natural succession resulting in slow colonization, despite the abundance of good mother alibangbang trees in the watershed.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/EDJ/article/view/195','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Ecosystems and Development Journal; Donaver M.

Key actors in the production-marketing continuum were identified as well as the facilitating and limiting factors of the business were determined. Respondents to the key informant interviews were rubber farmers, including tappers and caretakers of rubber farms, who supply cuplumps to Rubberfields Inc., the lone latex processing plant in Laguna. Staff members and technicians from Rubberfields Inc. and representatives from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Regional IV-A office were interviewed. Primary and secondary data were analyzed using thematic categories and descriptive statistics. There are 124.30 ha rubber farms distributed across 11 towns, with 53 farmer-stakeholders in the province. Agroforestry is the most common production scheme, where rubber is intercropped with various fruit-bearing trees. Most farmers used 70% unbudded and the remaining 30% were budded seedlings of RRIM 600, PB 235, PB 260, PB 311, PB 330, and USM 1 varieties. Most farmers employed 3m × 3m spacing, while the age of rubber trees ranged from 2 to 14 years. On average, farms produced 405 kg of latex per month. Production and marketing agreements between farmers and Rubberfields Inc. determined profit sharing. Rubberfields Inc. provides a regular marketing channel for the Laguna-based rubber farmers but there are other buyers who seasonally trade in the province. The pricing in Laguna largely depends on movement of latex prices in Mindanao. The province’s rubber agribusiness system has five sub-systems that open possibilities for expansion and improved contribution to the provincial economy while becoming more acceptable to farmers as they were already profiting from it. The estimated household’s annual net income from a 1.5-ha rubber-based farm is PhP 161,264.64.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/EDJ/article/view/198','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Ecosystems and Development Journal; Arturo Mark A.

The NFB inoculant with Azospirillum was produced at BIOTECH UPLB. The seedlings inoculated with AMF from Surigao, Mindanao mine tailing (coded as Sur) with or without NFB were raised at the screenhouse and planted in mine tailing site of Mogpog, Marinduque. After 27 mo, the highest height increment (202.5 cm) was noticed on A. mangium (126 cm) and on E. urophylla under Sur inoculation alone. The highest stem diameter increment of A. mangium (54.7 cm) was observed in Sur+NFB while for E. urophylla (29.9 cm) it was observed in Sur alone. Shoot and root dry weights of both species were highest in Sur. Total N uptake of both plants and P uptake of E. urophylla was highest in Sur inoculant while the P in A. mangium was highest in Sur+NFB treatment. Sur+NFB inoculated plants gave the highest population of NFB with highly significant effect in A. mangium while Sur alone accumulated the highest NFB in E. urophylla but with no significant effect on Sur+NFB and control counterpart. Mycorrhizal spore count of both plants were highest in Sur, while the highest percent root colonization in A. mangium was observed with Sur inoculation and with Sur+NFB inoculation in E. urophylla. Correlation analysis among growth, nutrient, and microbial parameters were also obtained. Root colonization and spore count in A. mangium were highly correlated. On the other hand, a high correlation between plant dry weight and root dry weight was obtained in E. urophylla.

To determine the effect of microbial inoculation on the absorption and translocation of HMs, three treatments consisting of no microbial inoculants, mycorrhiza and mycorrhiza+NFB were applied to three reforestation species following a 2-factor experiment in RCBD. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) values indicate that P. indicus, A. mangium and E. urophylla accumulated higher HMs in their roots with respect to their corresponding rhizosphere soil, therefore reducing the availability of HMs in the environment. Among the tree species P. indicus inoculated with mycorrhiza+NFB seems to be the best bioremediation species and most effective in reducing HM in soil having had the highest BCF for Cd, Pb and Cu. Moreover, even with just mycorrhizal treatment, P. indicus was still able to effectively exclude Cu having shown the highest translocation factor (TF) for Cu. All the three reforestation species, however, when inoculated with microbial fertilizers have the potential to remediate Cu, Pb and Cd laden soils and are recommended to be utilized in bioremediation of HM contaminated sites. It is also recommended that inoculants be tested on plants used as food in HM contaminated areas to determine their effects on their HM absorption to address the possibility of HM entry in the food chain.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/PJCS/article/view/358','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Lea Joy Morong, Nelly Aggangan','bioconcentration factor, phytoremediation, translocation factor',NULL,15,5,4,'University of the Philippines Los Baños',3,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(278,'2021-07-29 13:11:27','2021-07-29 13:11:27','Spore Production and Root Colonization of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi in Different Media and Levels of Biochar: Their Effect on Growth of Paspalum notatum','2019-12-02','Ecosystems and Development Journal Vol 44 No December (2019): Special Issue Bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum) is commonly used in the mass production of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal inoculants containing infective propagules, mycorrhizal roots and spores, and the growing medium.

After 3 months growth in mine tailing soil, following a 2-month growth in soil-sand mixture, the height (28.74 cm), stem diameter increment (3.58 cm), and root colonization (93%) of narra seedlings were all highest using inoculum isolated from AcaciaYellow. Phosphorus and heavy metal uptakes were higher in inoculated plants than control ones. Spores isolated from plants previously inoculated with mycorrhiza and from healthy plants in mine tailing sites promoted better growth of narra, which, can be used in the rehabilitation of abandoned mine tailings in Mogpog, Marinduque and in other similar sites in the Philippines.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/PJCS/article/view/362','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Ann Clarisse Siababa, Mannix Pedro, Verna Bautista, Nelly Aggangan','copper, acacia, heavy metals, phosphorus, MYKOVAM®',NULL,15,5,4,'University of the Philippines Los Baños',3,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(282,'2021-07-29 13:11:27','2021-07-29 13:11:27','Effectiveness of Multiple Inoculation of Biofertilizer with Biochar on Growth of Cacao (Theobroma cacao L.)

Seedlings were grown in acidic (pH 4.3, H2O) red soil amended with biochar (wt/wt) at 0 (control), 3.75, 7.5, and 15% and inoculated or uninoculated with the mycorrhizal fungi. The height, stem diameter, and dry weight of the roots, stems, and leaves of cacao significantly increased in mycorrhizal (+AMF) treatment after 6 mo. Regardless of biochar level, no effect in plant dry weight was observed. The combined addition of AMF + 15% BB synergistically improved the total biomass by 111% and nutrient (N and P) uptake compared to uninoculated cacao at 0% BB. The mycorrhizal fungi spore count from the rhizosphere and root infection in the cacao roots was generally improved by BB addition. Moreover, the chemical properties of the soil such as pH, available P, exchangeable K, and CEC were consistently improved by 15% BB.

Estimation of plant biomass is one of the methods used to determine the amount of stored carbon, which can help implement appropriate strategies to reduce environmental degradation and mitigate climate change. This study assessed the carbon sequestration and storage by three reforestation species: Pterocarpus indicus, Acacia mangium, and Eucalyptus urophylla, as influenced by microbial fungi with or without nitrogen fixing bacteria (NFB). Pterocarpus indicus were grown in a nursery in Gasan, Marinduque for 5 months, while A. mangium and E. urophylla were raised at the screen house of BIOTECH UPLB. Inoculation was done during pricking while lime and vermicompost were applied to all seedlings during field planting. Allometric equation developed by Martines-Yrizar et al. (1992) was used to determine biomass density using stem diameter and total height of the tree. Representative trees were excavated 27 months after field planting. Results showed that A. mangium and P. indicus inoculated with mycorrhiza + NFB showed a 128% and 17%, respectively, increase in accumulated biomass and CO2 content. In E. urophylla, 83% biomass increase was observed with mycorrhizal inoculation alone. The results suggest that plant biomass and carbon sequestration due to microbial inoculation vary depending on tree species. A. mangium produced higher plant biomass, that consequently, gave higher amount of stored or sequestered CO2 than E. urophylla and P. indicus. Similar studies should be conducted in other mined- out areas in the country to validate the results.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/PJCS/article/view/365','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Iris Ashley  Algabre, Elenita Racelis, Nelly Aggangan','Acacia mangium, Eucalyptus urophylla, mycorrhizal fungi, Pterocarpus indicus, nitrogen fixing bacteria',NULL,15,5,4,'University of the Philippines Los Baños',3,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(285,'2021-07-29 13:11:27','2021-07-29 13:11:27','Response of Three Cacao (Theobroma cacao L.)

With the rising demand, farmers need to improve and sustain farm productivity. Cultural management practices ensuring the production of marketable yield that meets the consumers’ requirement is a valuable information to improve productivity. This study sought to evaluate the effects of bunch trimming and fertilization scheme on productivity and fruit quality of Cardaba grown in Candelaria, Quezon. Bunch trimming involves two methods, removal of the male bract and the removal of the last hand consequently with the male bract. On the other hand, fertilization at recommended rate of 220-20-260 kg ha-1 NPK annually was compared with that of the farmer’s practice (FP). Results showed that fertilization at recommended rate with one hand trimmed produced larger (in terms of length and diameter) and high total soluble solids.

However, it is a short-season crop and highly perishable due to moisture loss, shrivelling, decay and bract discoloration that detracts consumer appeal and limit its marketable life. This study was conducted to extend the storage and shelf life of dragon fruit through modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) in combination with storage at low temperature. Excellent quality fruit harvested at 25-30 d after flowering were sleeved in polystyrene fruit cup and individually packed in 50.8 µm thick polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) non-perforated plastic bags. Sample fruits were withdrawn every 2 wk from storage at 5°C and transferred to 20°C for shelf life evaluation. MAP-stored fruit remained in excellent condition for up to 6 weeks at 5°C without any shrivelling thus fruits were firm, and bracts remained green. The use of polystyrene fruit cups generally aided in maintaining the visual quality of the fruit by protecting the bracts from breaking during handling. Non-packed (non-MA packed) fruits on the other hand lasted for only 4 wk at 5°C with noticeable change in visual quality and the bracts already exhibiting yellowing and tip browning. Shelf life at 20°C after a 4 wk storage of MA- and non-MA packed fruits were 5 d and 2 d, respectively. Extension of storage to 6 wk shortened the shelf life of MA-packed fruit to 3 d while non-MA packed were already unmarketable.

Response of cultivars to the timing of the stress at 14 d waterlogged duration was significant for seed yield and seed yield components. Based on seed yield damage index, PSB Sy1 was the most tolerant genotype followed by the landrace Manchuria; while PSB Sy6 and PSB Sy3 were most susceptible to waterlogging. The effect on soybean seed yield of the two waterlogging stress timings was statistically similar. The number of pods per plant, high percentage of seed-filled pods and the weight of seeds (per plant) were crucial seed yield components. Flooding stress caused decreases in root length and shoot dry matter partitioning in susceptible genotypes, whereas the tolerant PSB Sy1 (across waterlogging treatments) increased its root length, and leaf and stem-partitioned dry matter.

Although drying is known as a preservation technique for herbs such as onions, it is often accompanied with loss of volatiles and bioactive compounds. In this study, the changes in bioactive compounds of waste onion leaves in terms of total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) as well as flavor and aroma components such as sulfur-containing compounds using various dehydration techniques (sun drying, conventional drying, freeze drying and vacuum drying) were evaluated. Effects of drying parameters such as temperature, time, vacuum pressure and blanching on preservation of bioactive compounds in waste onion leaves were also investigated. Results showed that vacuum drying is the most efficient drying technique in terms of moisture reduction and TFC preservation but not with TPC retention. Conventional drying showed favorable results on the preservation of TPC and TFC but failed to reduce the moisture of onion leaves below 15%. Heating had a positive effect on TFC of dried onion leaves except for sun drying. Sun drying showed comparable performance with freeze drying in preserving TPC, however, the color and appearance of sun-dried samples were not retained and the desired moisture was not attained. Longer drying time and increasing pressure resulted to a more favorable retention of TPC while blanching significantly reduced the TPC. A decrease in TFC was observed at increasing temperature and shorter drying time. Sulfur-containing compounds like alk(en)yl mono-, di-, and tri-sulfides onions, which contribute to the aroma of onion, were detected in all the dried samples. From these results, the type of drying method can significantly affect the bioactive components, as well as the flavor and aroma of dried onion leaves.','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/index.php/PJCS/article/view/371','https://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/journals-uplb/public/journals/15/cover_issue_42_en_US.jpg','Myra Borines, Rex Demafelis, Jewel Capunitan, Lisa Stephanie Dizon, Rona Joyce Landoy, Raymund  Rodriguez','bioactives, conventional drying, dehydration, flavonoids, freeze drying, gallic acid, onion leaves, phenolics, quercetin, thiosulfinates, vacuum drying',NULL,15,5,4,'University of the Philippines Los Baños',3,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(290,'2021-07-29 13:11:27','2021-07-29 13:11:27','Growth Enhancement of Rice (Oryza sativa L.) by Zinc-Solubilizing Bacteria Isolated from Vesicular-Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Root Inoculant (VAMRI)','2020-04-12','Ecosystems and Development Journal Vol 45 No 1 (2020): April Issue 2020 Zinc deficiency is the most common soil micronutrient deficiency all over the world.

Our study was conducted to evaluate the changes in soil characteristics, growth, grain yield, nutrient uptake, and profitability of lowland rice PSB Rc18 grown in organic production systems. The experiment was laid out in RCBD with four replications and three treatments. The application of organic materials favorably affected the soil through the increase in microbial population and N mineralization. Rice grown under T1 exhibited vigorous growth, high yield (5.6 ton ha-1), but late maturing. On the other hand, rice grown under T2 had earliest heading and maturation. Though rice grown in T2 were less vigorous, it resulted in acceptable grain yield (4.8 ton ha-1) and comparable to those grown under T1 and T3 (synthetic fertilizer treatment). Nutrient uptake is similar for T1 and T3, while lowest in T2 which received less inputs. Organic production systems (T1 and T2) gain lesser profit/benefit if the price of ordinary palay is followed but incurs more profit/benefit if sold at premium price. Both T1 and T2 are profitable but T2 incurs less production cost and requires less input than T1, hence, T2 might further be optimized in order to gain higher grain yield.

Citrus is primarily valued for the fruit, which is either eaten alone as fresh fruit, processed into juice, or added to dishes and beverages. Various bacterial, fungal, viral and viral-like diseases attack citrus crop in Asia during the past couple of years. Among the fungal diseases of citrus, scab is very common. Citrus scab produces external blemishes on citrus fruit, reducing acceptability of the fruit for the fresh market. The disease is widespread in many humid, citrus-cultivating areas around the world. Different fungal species affect the citrus plants in different regions. Because these species cannot be reliably distinguished by morphological or cultural characteristics, host range and molecular methods must be used to identify different isolates. Presently, the plant disease detection techniques available are enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR is a more advance technique than ELISA.

GAD focal persons in government agencies are identified to mainstream implementation of GAD-related activities to include research and development. However, one of the limiting factors in gender-related research is the lack of technical knowledge on data analytics which is fundamental for decision-making. The Socio-Economics Research and Data Analytics Center in Luzon (SERDAC–Luzon) was established as a government’s response to this limitation. The Center aims to enhance the capacity of researchers in basic and advanced socio-economic research, especially on the use of statistical software for data analytics to a range of gender issues. Trainings were conducted among GAD focal persons to enhance their competency on the use of SPSS for data analytics. Lectures, discussions, and workshops using the software were the teaching modalities. Data on the GAD focal person participants in the trainings conducted at two universities were used.','https://doi.org/10.22137/ijeds.2020.v1n1.03',NULL,'Maria Yna Diane B.

Pinatubo in 1991 and the massive flooding in 2009 that further marginalized their farms. A self-construct questionnaire was used for 150 farming households. Socio-economic data, farm management practices, production, and income per household were described, pooled, and analyzed descriptively. As of 2018, rice farming was the main source of household income despite the land being less suitable for rice and production area reduced. There was low productivity and a high yield gap compared with the province’s and the region’s yield levels. There was high input cost in rice farming due to various factors including the marginal condition of the farms. There was low income from rice farming during both seasons, but the yield was much lower during the wet season due to lower yield.','https://doi.org/10.22137/ijeds.2020.v1n1.02',NULL,'Maria Excelsis M.

The role of non-AFF undergraduate programs as a means to further research in AFF fields are highlighted in this study using the case of the BS Biology Program of Bicol University which may be reflective of other HEIs in the country. A total of 271 of the 865 undergraduate theses conducted in the Department of Biology from 1986 to 2019 were under AFF. Majority of the studies were on post-harvest and plant pathology of locally important commodities such as rice, coconut and pili. However, there were no records of publication. AFF - allied undergraduate programs like biology can be a source of valuable and valid research data to augment AFF researches in the region and in the country. Mechanisms to encourage publication of student outputs are also imperative for proper and wide dissemination of results. Inclusive undergraduate research agenda, co-mentoring and cohesive institutional academic policies are among the strategies to further strengthen the AFF contributions of allied undergraduate programs','http://journal.bicol-u.edu.ph/index.php/rnd/article/view/96/87',NULL,'Jonathan Jaime G.

Batac rooted easily while Kokuso rooted with difficulty. the levels of auxin-like substances in the shoot apex and base of the stem cuttings before and after rooting were analyzed using the HIgh Performance Liquid Chromatography [HPLC] and the Salkowski Reagent Tests. The levels of these auxin-like substance in Batac and Kokuso cutting before and after rooting were not statistically different although the level in Kokuso was slightly higher in the shoot before rooting. There was a decrease of the substances in the base after rooting in both varieties indicating that the hormone was utilized for rooting. Similarly, the amount of Abscisic acid-like substances were not significantly different in the two varieties.Sugar was higher in Batac cuttings than in Kokuso cuttings. Initial levels of nitrogen were the same in the two cultivars but was higher in Batac after rooting. Sugar was higher in Batac but starch was higher in Kokuso.Rooting percentage, number of roots length of Kokuso stem cuttings correspondingly increased when dipped in increasing concentrations of IBA.

Significant difference between Sub1 lines and their recurrent parent was observed only in 1000-grain weight. No significant effects on duration to maturity, plant height, number of productive tillers, panicle length, number of spikelets, fertility and yield was observed between Sub1 lines and their recurrent parent under control condition. However, differences were observed in specific pair, for example, IR64 relatively produced more spikelet and longer panicle than its Sub1; while the latter had relatively longer maturity in both seasons. Furthermore, IR64 was relatively taller, more fertile and yielded more than its Sub1 during the dry season. The tolerant genotypes FR13A, IR64-Sub1, Samba Mahsuri-Sub1, PSB Rc68, IR49830-7-1-2-3, IR70181-32-PM1-1-1-5-1 and IR82355-5-1-3 had 82%, 76%,69%, 68%, 68%, 65% and 64% survival under complete submergence for two weeks, respectively. Complete submergence for 24 hours significantly affect the duration to maturity, plant height, number of productive tillers and number of spikelets per panicle. The recurrent parents and Sub1 lines showed similar agronomic responses and yield after 24 hour submergence. Most of the physical and chemical grain quality aspects of Sub1 lines were similar to that of their recurrent parents in both seasons. Sub1 lines were rated higher during the wet season. IR64 was more acceptble either as cooked orÂ  as raw grains when produced during the dry season, while Sub1 line was more acceptable during the wet season. Cooked grains of Swarma and its Sub1 were similarly acceptable in both seasons whereas, the raw grains of Swarma-Sub1Â  were acceptable in both seasons. IR 64 was relatively more chalky, had longer grain and higher length/width ratio than its Sub1 while the latter was perceived as more glossy when cooked and more brittle when raw.

The research problem was addressed by generating quantitative evidence of the synchrony of insect reproduction and flower development at the population and individual level, and by experimentally testing the hypothesis that the stage of mango flower development affects <em>I. clypealis</em> ovarian development. The age structure of I<em>. clypealis</em> population during mango flower development was analyzed. From flower emergence to anthesis, the population of mango leafhoppers was composed predominantly of eggs and early nymphal instars (first and second instar) indicating a young and growing population. The age class composition, however, shifted to older nymphs (third and fourth instar) and adults after flower anthesis. The unimodal nature and sequential appearance of distinct narrow peaks of the various age classes strongly indicate that only one generation of mango leafhopper developed in the entire duration of flower development. The rate of ovarian development of newly emerged adults reared in flowers was studied under field conditions. There were four distinct stages of ovarian development identified and described based on the morphological changes in the ovarioles and the growth of the oocytes. The previtellogenic stages, N1 and N2, were observed in 1 to 13 day old while the vitellogenic stage P1 was observed in 1 to 16 day old. The P2 stage characteristic of an egg laying individual was observed in only 6.67% of the 16 day old sample. These observations suggest that the rate of development from N1 to P1 could be fast and that these stages were prolonged. The duration of flower development did not seem sufficient to support the ovarian development of <em>I. clypealis. </em>Ovarian development was further studied in a field experiment with stage of flower as a dependent variable. The rate of ovarian development as affected <br />by feeding on mango flowers of various stages differed significantly across time. <br />Fat body rating similarly varied with the treatments across time. Nevertheless, <br />the results have limited biological implication because <em>I. clypealis</em> did not develop <br />into the egg laying stage. Evidences generated in this study show that at the population level, mango leafhopper reproduction and development is synchronized with mango flower development. This synchrony however, could not be supported by the ovarian development of <em>I. clypealis</em> in flowers at the individual level. Ovarian <br />development of <em>I. clypealis</em> could have been controlled by other factors other than <br />mango flowering. <br />',NULL,NULL,'Pascual, Oscar Peter D.','postharvest mechanization$xrice$zSorsogon, decision support',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/Effect of Mango Flowering on the ovarian development of mango leafhopper_ab_249579.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(1944,'2021-09-01 07:44:42','2021-09-01 07:44:42','Design, construction and evaluation of a batch-type coffee roaster for small-scale roasting','2021-09-01','A batch-type coffee roaster that can be used for small-scale roasting was designed and fabricated at the College of Engineering and Agro-Industrial Technology, UPLB, College, Laguna to evaluate the machine performance and establish the best combination of the operating parameters involved, namely: auger speed, roasting time, and valve opening.

Carabao) fruits to carnauba-based skin coating.>','1980-09-01','Physiologically immature (95 DAFI) and mature green (112 DAFI) green mango fruits were coated with 40% carnauba-skin coating and stored at ambient (25+2oC) and in cold store (13 oC) for 21 days. The mango peel was examined under scanning electron microscope (SEM) to view its anatomy. The dermal layer was then related to some physico-chemical, physiological and chemical responses of the fruit at each peel color index (PCI) to the skin coating applied. Sensory analysis by consumer acceptance test was also done and the market implication on the use of skin coating was briefly discussed. Results obtained from the scanning micrographs showed sharper pentagonal cuticular platelets at PCI 1 flattened out at advanced peel color stages. Cuticular platelets (67 to 83 mm diameter) from immature fruits seemed closer together while in the mature fruit, cuticular platelets appeared bigger (110 and 200 mm diameter) and stretched. Regardless of maturity, application of skin coating caused cuticular platelets to be indiscernible especially at PCI 6. Examination of the peel cross section images revealed small intercellular spaces in the dermal tissues and initially (PCI 1), the dermal tissue showed flaky scales then became spongy and disintegrated at PCI 6. Skin coating minimized dermal tissue disintegration even at advanced PCI. Regardless of maturity, skin coating added sheen to the fruits, significantly prevented weight loss and extended postharvest life relative to the uncoated fruits. Uncoated mature and immature fruits at ambient reached full yellow color 10 and 15 days, respectively, before the cold stored uncoated and skin coated mature fruits (21 days). Immature mangoes (coated or uncoated) stored in the cold did not reach PCI 6. Application of skin coating on immature magoes stored in the cold was able to delay attainment of PCI 5 (23 days) relative to skin coated mature mangoes (18 days). Skin coated mature and immature fruits stored in the cold exhibited longer postharvest life (33 days) than uncoted ones (31-32 days). However, the postharvest life of uncoated and skin coated mature and immature fruits stored at ambient was low (17 and 21 days, respectively). For mature fruits, unsynchronized pulp and peel ripening was observed at PCI 6 with the delay of the attainment peel color concomitant with lowering of flesh firmness and increased total soluble solids (TSS). Internal breakdown (IB) a physiological disorder of â€˜Carabaoâ€™ mango was observed in immature fruits but not in mature fruits. The fruits followed a climacteric respiratory pattern with most ethylene peaks preceding the respiratory climacteric peak then rising again at a later stage of ripening. The skin coated mature mangoes in cold storage had lower levels of internal oxygen and higher levels of internal carbon dioxide compared to the uncoated mature mangoes in cold store. At 2009 mango prices and considering other cost assumptions, application of skin coating even to mature â€˜Carabaoâ€™ mango fruits was found not to be economically viable if marketed locally.',NULL,NULL,'Dela Cruz, Leo C.','FISHERMEN, ECONOMIC SOCIOLOGY, Fisheries',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/PCR-10-0069_ab_128481.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(1946,'2021-09-01 07:44:42','2021-09-01 07:44:42','Dynamics of collaboration and partnership in community development program of selected agrarian reform communities (ARCs) in Laguna','1980-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Abaday, Leopoldo C.','IRRIGATION, SUGARCANE, LEGUMES, ENGINEERING, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/PCR-11-0003_ab_172009.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(1947,'2021-09-01 07:44:42','2021-09-01 07:44:42','Environmental assessment of farm household wastewater for vegetable production in Maria Paz, Tanauan City, Batangas, Philippines','1984-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Juanillo, Richard M.','RURAL DEVELOPMENT, AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT, CAGAYAN, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/PCR-11-0004_ab_172018.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(1948,'2021-09-01 07:44:42','2021-09-01 07:44:42','Analysis of the contribution of the pandan handicraft industry to community economic development in Luisiana, Laguna, Philippines','1984-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Adan, William R.','FISHERIES, DIFFUSION OF INFORMATION, PHILIPPINES, Communications',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/PCR-11-0023_ab_173494.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(1949,'2021-09-01 07:44:42','2021-09-01 07:44:42','The dynamics of empowerment in people-oriented forestry projects, Region IV, Philippines','1992-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Aganon, Clarita P.','CLAY SOILS, ANNUALS, SOIL WATER CONTENT, PLANT WATER RELATIONS',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/PCR-11-0029_ab_173514.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(1950,'2021-09-01 07:44:42','2021-09-01 07:44:42','Analysis of the biophysical and social factors affecting the utilization and management of Sagumayon-Macabalo River in Legazpi City and Daraga, Albay, Philippines','2021-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Baracol, Lorelle A.','Farmers Informaion and Technology Services$xeconomic impact$zQuezon Province, lanzones$xfarming system, coconut$xfarming system, Statistics',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/PCR-11-0044_ab_174060.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(1951,'2021-09-01 07:44:42','2021-09-01 07:44:42','Application of GeoWEPP model in simulating runoff and soil loss of Mapawa Watershed in Bukidnon, Philippines','2021-09-01','The study aimed to apply the geospatial interface of Water Erosion Prediction Project (GeoWEPP) model in simulating runoff and soil loss of the Mapawa watershed in Songco, Lantapan, Bukidnon, Philippines. The study was conducted from April 2007 to January 2009. Primary data collection included watershed surveys and soil sampling. Secondary data collection included from MSEC, NAMRIA, and SANREM through the PPDO of Malaybalay City. Moreover, because the study is methodological in nature, familiarization with the applied models, preparation of data input files, simulation implementations, calibration of input parameters, final model implementation, and model outputs analyses and validation were undertaken. In GeoWEPP erosion modeling, four basic input files corresponding to local climate, slope, land management, and soil were generated. Climate input file was generated within BPCDG program using a one year and standard weather dataset. Slope input file was derived from the created spurious-free 3-meter resolution DEM of the study site. Soil and management input files were generated based on primary data from the study site and supplemented with the built-in databases of the WEPP program. In addition, database files were created to link WEPP with GIS application software through its geospatial interface. After series of adjustments made to the input parameters, WEPP simulated sediment yield from the 5 weirs of respective main and subwatersheds with an average RMSE of 5.32 and IA of 0.96. On a per rainfall event basis, WEPP predicted runoff and soil loss of the entire watershed with an average RMSE of 12,154 and 5.0, and IA of 0.55 and 0.95 respectively. Based on a per cropped area, the observed and predicted sediment yields of 80.5 t.ha-1yr-1 and 89.2 t.ha-1yr-1, respectively, for the entire watershed far exceed the tolerable limit of 10 t.ha-1yr-1. This indicates that the sustainability of the soil in the cultivated parcels within the watershed may be difficult to attain under the observed and predicted sediment yield scenarios. The results indicate that with appropriate calibration of parameters, GeoWEPP can be applied in simulating runoff and soil loss volumes of a small and agriculturally active watershed in Bukidnon. Despite limited number of datasets for validation, the model performed satisfactorily with promising results.

(Family Zingiberaceae) by utilizing morphological characters, leaf epidermal data and foliar flavonoid tests. In addition, herbarium studies, literature review, botanical field collections and cultivation of specimens were conducted. The botanical exploration study sites include Mt. Kitanglad, Bukidnon; Impalutao Forest Reserve, Bukidnon; Mt. Malambo1 and Mt Malambo2, Marilog District, Davao City; Mt. Hamiguitan, Davao Oriental; Bislig Experimental Forest, Surigao del Sur and Bigaan Forest, Surigao del Sur. The botanical exploration of this study revealed that Amomum species thrive in forest edges, inside forest areas having partial shade, steep to flat areas and along river banks. The elevation on which these plants grow ranges from 34 to 1728 m above sea level on soil types of clay, sandy clay, sandy loam to loamy sand. The soil pH is from 4.60 to 7.18. There are six Amomum species recorded in this study, namely: Amomum maximum Roxb., A. microcheila (Ridl.) Merr., A. muricarpum Elm. and three proposed new taxa designated as Amomum bracteo-apiculatum Acma sp. nov. ined., A. membranaceum Acma sp. nov. ined. and A. petiolatum Acma sp. nov. ined. Of the six species of Amomum reported, only one species, A. maximum Roxb. is not endemic to the Philippines. The said species is a new record for the country. During the study, six other species which were previously placed under the genus Amomum but are now transferred to other genera of tribe Alpinieae were examined. These species include Geocharis fusiformis (Ridl.) R.M. Smith; Etlingera dalican (Elm.) Poulsen; Etlingera philippinense (Ridl.) R.M. Smith; Hornstedtia lophophora Ridl.; H. pubescens (Ridl.) Elm. and H. conoidea Ridl. The present study agrees with the current taxonomic disposition of the above-mentioned taxa. The shape, texture and length of ligule, length of petiole, texture and size of floral bracts, and characteristic of the labellum and calyx are diagnostic characters used to separate the different Amomum species. Anatomical observations on the leaf epidermis have shown that Amomum have broad subsidiary cells and most of its stomata are located near the veins. The result of the flavonoid tests support the segregation of A. petiolatum Acma sp. nov. ined. from A. muricarpum Elm. The cultivation and propagation aspects of this study have noted the survival of a number of the planted collections. This indicates that ex-situ conservation approach for these species is possible. Recommendations specifically for the improvement of our knowledge on Philippine Amomum as to their utilization and conservation are offered in this study. <br />',NULL,NULL,'Eusebio, Editha P.','forestry$xcommunity development$zRegion IV, empowerment$xforestry',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/PCR-11-0078_ab_179876.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(1954,'2021-09-01 07:44:42','2021-09-01 07:44:42','Optimization of soil auger blade on clay and clay loam soils.','2021-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Floresca, Januel P.','agroecosystems, rice$xagroecosystems$zlowland$zEchague, Isabela, Environmental science',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/PCR-11-0085_ab_179944.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(1955,'2021-09-01 07:44:42','2021-09-01 07:44:42','Prevalence and risk factors of zoonotic protozoa among small-holder livestock farmers in Aurora Province','1977-09-01','This cross-sectional study determined the prevalence and risk factors of zoonotic pathogenic protozoa among animal handlers engaged in small holder livestock farming in Aurora province. Specifically, the study also determined the prevalence of zoonotic protozoa infection among livestock animals by mode of transmission (arthropod-borne, water-borne/fecal-oral route, food-bone) and examined for the presence of associations between the different risk factors and zoonotic protozoa infection among animal handlers and livestock. The exposure variables for animal handlers included educational attainment, hand washing practices, high risk farm activities, characteristics of drinking water source, ingestion of raw or uncooked meat, manner of excreta and garbage disposal, sanitary quality and use of toilet and herd size. Whereas, exposure variables for livestock included 10% diarrheal incidence and manner of anti diarrheal medication in the farm, acaricidal application, entry of new stock, access to natural bodies of water and presence of animal scavengers (cats and/or rats) in the farm. The study was conducted from June 2007 to October 2009. There were 678 animal handlers enrolled in the study and more than a hundred animals â€“ cattle, buffaloes, goats, pigs, dogs, chickens and cats examined. The presence of protozoa was detected by microscopy and PCR from fecal DNA of animal handlers and blood DNA from cattle, buffalo, rats and animal handlers. Among the zoonotic protozoa affecting the small holder livestock farmers in Aurora province, four enteric protozoa that could be transmitted by water or fecal- oral route were detected. <em>Cryptosporidium parvum</em> had the highest prevalence which was the same for both male and female animal handlers (21%) and the highest among the age groups. Highest prevalence of <em>Cryptosporidium</em> was found in pigs (30%), followed by cattle (27%), similar prevalence in buffaloes and chickens (21%), goats (18%) and dogs (10%). The second protozoon prevalent among animal handlers and livestock in this study is <em>Blastocystis hominis.</em> Its prevalence is higher among male (2.4%) than female animal handlers (1.9%). It was detected among animal handlers from ages 26 years old and above. Cattle, buffaloes, goats, pigs, chickens and dogs were infected with <em>B. hominis</em> with pigs having the highest prevalence (29%). Similarly, all animal handlers whose animals were found infected with <em>B. hominis</em> were also infected with the same enteric protozoa by microscopy. <em>Entamoeba histolytica</em> had a very low prevalence (less than 1%) among animal handlers by PCR. The prevalence of Giardia among animal handlers was quite low (less than 1%). Both arthropod borne blood protozoa namely <em>Babesia microti</em> and <em>Trypanosoma evansi</em> were not present among animal handlers. However, <em>T. evansi </em>was detected among cattle and buffaloes with prevalence less than 1%. Two food borne zoonotic protozoa were examined. In spite of the 30% prevalence of <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> among cats examined in the study, it was not detected in the blood DNA samples of all animal handlers by PCR. In spite of the 6.49% prevalence of <em>Sarcocystis spp.</em> infection among dogs examined in the study, it was not detected in the blood DNA samples of animal handlers who owned the infected dogs. The study also determined the association between the different possible exposure variables and enteric zoonotic protozoa infection among animal handlers using multiple logistic regression while controlling for the confounders. Specifically, questionable or poor source of water in an unclean surroundings as evidenced by presence of excreta in the vicinity (OR=1.79, 95% CI: 1.13, 2.8; p=0.014) and good source of water but with excreta in the vicinity (OR=1.50, 95% CI: 1.0, 3.0; p=0.052) were associated with the infection among animal handlers. Lastly, moderate to maximum number of animals in the herd (OR=1.9, 95% 1.2, 3.0, p=0.010) was significantly associated with enteric zoonotic protozoa infection among animal handlers. Among livestock, the presence of diarrhea was significantly associated with enteric zoonotic protozoa infection (OR=6.43, 95% CI:1.13, 19.4, p<0.001) among cattle. The presence of scavengers was significantly associated with enteric zoonotic protozoa infection while controlling for confounders ( OR=2.7, 95% CI:1.4, 5.6, p=0.005). The presence of diarrhea in the farm (OR=2.0, 95% CI:0.8,5.4, p=0.049) was significantly associated with enteric protozoa infection among goats. Access to natural bodies of water (OR=3.35, 95% CI:1.3,8.4, p=0.10) and exposure to animal scavengers (OR=2.9, 95% CI: 1.6, 5.3, p=0.001) were significantly associated with chicken infection. <br /><br />',NULL,NULL,'Aquino, Josephine M.','MILKFISH, FISHERY PRODUCTION, BRACKISH WATER, PONDS, Fisheries',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/PCR-11-0090_ab_180915.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(1956,'2021-09-01 07:44:42','2021-09-01 07:44:42','Characterization and suitability evaluation of major agricultural soils towards rationalizing land area allocation for biofuel feedstocks in Cagayan Valley, Philippines','1979-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Araral, Eduardo Al.','DAIRY CATTLE, HERDS, PERFORMANCE, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/PCR-12-0003_ab_225923.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(1957,'2021-09-01 07:44:42','2021-09-01 07:44:42','Design and development of a sweet sorghum seeder with fertilizer applicator','2021-09-01','This study was conducted to design and develop a sweet sorghum seeder with fertilizer applicator.

Data collection was performed through environmental services assessment of the randomly selected sample plots within the agroforestry plantation and economic variables that involved focus group discussions and household interviews using survey questionnaire. There was no significant difference between the two projects in terms of average annual household income before, during and after the project implementation. Most of their income were generated through farming. Regarding the financial efficiency analysis, CBRMP and SPISP agroforestry projects showed a negative Net Present Value amounted to Php-643.81 and Php -409.80, respectively. Much of the income generated out of the species planted were utilized for food consumption. CBRMP and SPISP accumulated 687.56 Mg ha-1 and 316.03 Mg ha-1 carbon, rspectively. CBRMP and SPISP had moderate to high species diversity for trees/perennial (2.91 and 2.74), intermediate (3.06 and 2.6) and undergrowth  (2.89 and 2.58), respectively.

This pot experiment examined the phytoremediation potential and copper toxicity responses of three agroforestry tree species growing in the copper contaminated site in Mogpog, Marinduque. Soil amendments such as VAM and zeolite were also tested to identify options for the efficient use of phytoremediation. Results showed that the use of zeolite and VAM were not significant in the overall performance of the three species indicating not only the species\' tolerance but also their practical applicability in remediating copper contaminated areas in the country. Interestingly, both <em>Vitex parviflora</em> and <em>Samanea saman</em> have the ability to transport Cu at an average of 37.0 and 78.25 Âµg g<sup>-1 </sup>dry wt, respectively, from roots to shoots beyond the toxicity threshold (20-30 Âµg g<sup>-1 </sup>dry wt) and appear as suitable for phytoextraction in the absence of hyper-accumulating tree species. All the three species, however, limited high levels of Cu translocation within the roots; hence, are highly suited for phytostabilization or for delimiting areas with copper toxicity. Moreover, Cu reduction in the soil ranged from 75.9-78.27% confirming previous observations that native species in mine tailings are most ideal species in heavy metals removal.',NULL,NULL,'Dati, Johnny G.','potato, Solanum tuberosum, stem cutting$xpotato, shoot growth$xpotato, tuber formation$xpotato, paclobutrazol, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/Phytoremediation potential of three agroforestry species in coppercontaminated soils in marinduque_ab_178225.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(1966,'2021-09-01 07:44:42','2021-09-01 07:44:50','Morphological and biochemical investigations on three sapindaceous species: longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour. ssp. longan var. longan), lychee (Litchi chinensis Sonn. ssp. chinensis) and alupag (L. chinensis Radlk. spp. philippinensis (Radlk.) Leenh.).','1990-09-01','Seed and seedling morphology and isozyme analysis of longan, lychee, and alupag were carried out to characterize the three taxa, to measure the genetic identity and genetic distance, and to elucidate the taxonomic interrelationships of the aforementioned taxa. Longan, lychee and alupag differed greatly in seed shape, color, seed index, hilum shape, and submicroscopic testa pattern. Clustering of the distance matrix obtained from the seed and seedling morphological data using the Unweighted Pair Group Method - Arithmetic Average revealed a close similarity between longan and alupag. However, longan, lychee and alupag exhibited the same seed germination pattern (i.e. hypogeal and cryptocotylar) and the same seedling developmental type (i.e. Horsfieldia type and subtype). In terms of overall appearance, seedlings of alupag were more similar to those of longan than to those of lychee, indicating a wide morphological difference between lychee and alupag which were supposedly subspecies of Litchi chinensis. A total of 16 presumptive loci were detected for the six enzymes investigated: one for isocitrate dehydrogenase, two each for acid phosphatase and leucine aminopeptidase, three each for phosphoglucose isomerase and phosphoglucomutase, and five for peroxidase. Comparative analysis of the three taxa clearly showed that they were distinct species. Mean genetic identity and genetic distance values for pair-wise comparison of longan, lychee and alupag showed a very low genetic identity value of 0.69 for lychee and alupag. This value was lower than identity values observed for subspecific taxa. Concordance between the enzyme data and the morphological data indicated that alupag was a separate species and not a subspecies of L. chinensis. Therefore, the binomial nomenclature, L. philippinensis, which was given by Radlkofer for alupag, should be retained.

Experimental set-up and testing were conducted to identify the factors (input variables) and processes that could produce the desired product. The settings/values of the factors were then narrowed down to come up with a range of values that produce acceptable results. For the factor optimization, Central Composite Design with two variables was ultimately used because two of the original four variables intended to be usedÂ with Box-Behnken design were not realized because of the limitation of the improvised equipment and the result of the initial experimental testing. The final factors used were blanching temperature and baking time; whereas the air velocity was set at 250 fpm and the different banana slice thickness, 2mm and 1.5mm, were tested separately. The value range of the blanching temperatureÂ used for both the 2mm and 1.5mm banana slices were 60-70<sup>o</sup>C. For the baking time of 2mm and 1.5mm, the value range is 11.65-12.35 minutes and 10-25-10.75 minutes, respectively. Response surface analysis method was utilized to optimize the range of the factors that result to the highest desirability of the optimization process, based on the attributes of the commercial banana chips and the result of sensory test by the panels. Objective test was used for the physico-chemical attributes of the crisps, whereas sensory test was used to evaluate the sensory attributes of the samples with varying treatments. For both the physico-chemical and sensory attributes of the 2mm banana crisps, the optimum solution values of blanching temperature and baking time are 72.07<sup>o</sup>C and 12.35 minutes, respectively at the air velocity inside the oven of 250 fpm. The solution desirability of the physico-chemical and sensory attributes optimization is 57.9% and 45.3%, respectively. The solution desirability is the desirability value for this solution relative to the upper and lower limits that were chosen for the responses and factors. For the 1.5mm banana slices, the optimum solution values of blanching temperature and baking time for the physico-chemical attributes are 68.12<sup>o</sup>C and 10.33 minutes, respectively, also at air velocity of 250 fpm. For the crisps\' sensory attributes the optimum solution values of blanching temperature and baking time are 70<sup>o</sup>C and 10.25 minutes, respectively.

In the laboratory, protein deprived flies were subjected to an attractancy experiment in a choice test and a feeding experiment in a no-choice test. Field test was conducted in the UPLB fruit orchard using an improvised trap to evaluate the respective baits in capturing wild population of fruitflies. Baits in the laboratory and field test were correlated to their protein crude content and pH. The attractancy experiment showed that the response of <em>B. occipitalis</em> and <em>B. philippinensis</em> varied with age and sex. Young female and old male flies of both species were attracted most to bakerâ€™s yeast while their young male counterparts to brewerâ€™s yeast. Old female flies of <em>B. philippinensis</em>, on the other hand, were most attracted to autolysed yeast. The feeding experiment showed that bakerâ€™s yeast as a potential bait for both <em>B. occipitalis</em> and <em>B. philippinensis</em> and that sex and age to bait was not much of a factor. In the field test, autolysed yeast outperformed bakerâ€™s yeast in capturing wild population of fruit flies from both sexes and followed by bakerâ€™s yeast. The variation in the results of the laboratory and field trials could not be attributed to the crude protein analysis and pH of the baits.

An assay for 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-Carboxylic acid (ACC) of the mango fruit peel collected at different time intervals after inoculation of the nonpathogenic mutant and wild-type <i></i>C. gloeosporioides<i></i> Penz. isolates, revealed an abrupt increase in ACC level 38 hours after mutant inoculation and 7 hours after challenge by 68% higher than the control (0.837 versus 0.497 nmol. g<sup></sup>-1<sup></sup> peel tissue).

The assessment identified the current land uses, strengths, limitations, opportunities and threats, and the alternative LUT based on land capability and crop suitability. Specifically, the study aimed to: 1) delineate slope classes to serve as land units for characterization and planning; 2) identify and describe the current land uses including the situation and conditions of the natural resources of the area; 3) characterize the soils and assess the biodiversity of grasslands and forest; 4) determine land capability and crop suitability of the land units; 5) propose alternative LUT for each land unit based on productivity, economic viability and ecological soundness; 6) determine soil loss of the current and proposed LUT; 7) establish the carrying capacity of the delineated land units; and 8) recommend soil and water management practices for the proposed alternative LUT. Data were gatherd through key informant interviews, resources inventory, and documentary analysis. Four major LUT were found and these were citrus, ginger and rice farming, and secondary or primary forest. Secondary or primary forest was the most dominant LUT with 83.65 % of the watershed covered. Citrus, ginger, and rice farming had benefit-cost ratios of 5.62, 6.34, and 2.62, respectively. These were indicative of their economic viability. Guimbalon clay loam dominated the undulating to mountainous slope ( eight percent and above), and the level to nearly level slopes belonged to Umingan loam. These had aggregate land areas of 1,214.95 and 600.75 ha, respectively. Estimated soil loss in current LUT ranged from 10.71 to 64.24 Mg/ha per year. Citrus and ginger farms in the 15-25% slope had the highest estimated annual soil loss. The grasslands were capable of producing up to 9t of fresh forage during the five-month rainy period, and had a carrying capacity of 1.3 animal unit months. A hectare of grassland can provide continuous forage supply to an animal unit for 1.3 months (40 days). Forest timber volume per hectare was 1,297 m<sup></sup>3<sup></sup>, or a total timber reserve of 1,969,883.60 m<sup></sup>3<sup></sup>. Approximately 269,642.95 m<sup></sup>3<sup></sup> will be depleted in the next ten years based on per capita timber consumption and current rate of forest conversion in Malabing due to the expansion of citrus plantations. It will take 21 years before Malabing can reach the allowable forest conversion ceiling for sustainable water supply in a watershed  (>60% forest cover). Below the required forest cover, water supply in the watershed will not be able to sustain human needs and irrigation for agriculture in the low lying areas. Biodiversity indices were 2.1831 and 2.1376 bits per individual for grassland and forest, respectively. Both ecosystems were moderately diverse. Some citrus orchards were severely affected by <i>Citrus tristeza</i> virus (CTV) and the greening disease. Insect pests most destructive were rind borer (<i>Prays endolemma</i>), rust mites (<i>Phyllocoptuta olievora</i>), and citrus fruit fly (<i>Dacus dorsalis</i>). The alternative LUT to adopt are as follows: 1) irrigated rice with soil organic matter content enhancement (SOMCE) and direct organic fertilizer application; 2) citrus with resource conservation-oriented farming systems (RCOFS), SOMCE, and liming; 3) ginger with RCOFS, SOMCE and liming; 4) secondary forest with forest resources enrichment for sustainable timber production (FOREST) and gully stabilization.

To gain insights on the molecular explanation of the makapuno phenomenon, the cDNA sequence variation and transcript profile of selected genes were investigated in normal and mutant makapuno coconut solid endosperm at different stages of development. A total of 14 partial cDNAs were studied. Of these, eight genes, namely: two putative isoforms of a-D-galactosidase gene (Cnagal1 and Cnagal2), cystosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Cngap), cystolic pyruvate kinase (Cnpk), enolase (Cneno), pyruvate decarboxylase (Cnpdc) and two putative isoforms of ketoacyl-ACP synthasse I (Cnkas1-1 and Cnkas1-2) are involved in carbon metabolism. Two genes, arginine decarboxylase (Cnadc) and isopentenyl transferase (Cnipt) are for hormone biosynthesis. Four regulatory factors, namely, myb-like transcription factor (Cnmyb), poly(A)-binding protein (Cnpab), protein kinase CK2 beta chain (Cnckb) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (cnelF-4A) were also cloned. These cDNAs harbor conserved domains and have 68-98% identity to other plant sequences. For all these genes, the makapuno and normal coconut endosperms have identical nucleotide and amino acid sequences. Expression analysis in normal coconut and makapuno solid endosperm using Relative RT-PCR with actin as reference gene revealed four genes (Cnipt, Cngap, Cnpk, and Cneno) with lower expression in the makapuno. Genes which were upregulated in the makapuno include Cnpdc, Cnpab, Cnmyb, Cnagal1, Cnckb, and Cnkas1.

The evaluation was based on the multi-criteria sustainability rating formulated following the schemes earlier used by Barcellano (2005), Gascon (1998) and Legada (1998). The parameters used were ecological soundness, economic viability, cultural sensitivity and social equitability. The soil chemical and physical analyses revealed that the multistorey farms had significantly higher pH, OM, N, Ca, WHC and MC. The soil in the alley cropping system had significantly higher K, Mg and CEC. The soil in the trees along the farm boundary system had significantly higher P and BD. The multistorey farms had statistically higher infiltration rates and statistically lower recorded runoffs compared to all the other agroforestry practices. Sediment yield in the multistorey was significantly lower compared to the amount obtained from other practices. The amounts of litter production and decomposition were statistically higher in the multistorey system compared to the other agroforestry practices. All the agroforestry practices have very rich species diversity. The water in the streams met the Class A criteria for fresh water classification in terms of pH, turbidity, conductivity, nitrogen, phosphorus, TDS and TSS. All the agroforestry practices which provide 86-89% of the farmersâ€™ household income produced positive net returns, but these were still below the poverty line. External support and credit were not provided to most of the farmers. The individual beliefs and rituals of the farmers were observed to be diminishing. The practice of agroforestry was observed to have led to increased participation and improved the organization of the farmers. <br />There was inequality in income and land area distribution among the farmers. There were also differences in the quality of living and access to basic services among the farmers. The agroforestry practices that obtained moderately high sustainability rating based on the developed multi-criteria evaluation scheme were alley cropping (57.96%), followed by multistorey (56.60%) and trees along farm boundary (55.35%). The lowest sustainability rating was that of the fallow system at 48.73% which was considered moderately low in terms of overall sustainability. <br />',NULL,NULL,'Camalig, Fe M.','ruminants$xdisease control, yemane$xefficacy, Gmelina arborea, leaf extracts$xyemane, gastrointestinal nematodes',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/PCR-11-0053_ab_174979.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(1996,'2021-09-01 07:44:43','2021-09-01 07:44:43','Isolation and characterization of Shiga (Vero) toxin-producing <em>Escherichia coli </em>O157:H7 in dairy cattle (<em>Bos taurus</em>) from selected farms in Luzon, Philippines','1976-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Alcala, Eugenio L.','SORGHUM, RICE, YIELDS, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/PCR-11-0055_ab_176962.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(1997,'2021-09-01 07:44:43','2021-09-01 07:44:43','Morpho-agronomic and grain physical characterization of introduced and locally developed hybrid rice varieties.','2021-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Decena, Anita A.','pandan$xHandicraft, handicraft$xeconomic development$zLuisiana, Laguna, Community development, Social sciences',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/PCR-11-0067_ab_179389.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(1998,'2021-09-01 07:44:43','2021-09-01 07:44:43','Exogenous application of L-proline for inducing drought tolerance in lowland rice (Oryza sativa L.).','1983-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Andin, Neria A.','SYZYGIUM, PEST CONTROL, CULTURAL METHODS, PHLAEOTHRIPIDAE, THRIPS, GALL CAUSING INSECT, Forestry',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/PCR-11-0081_ab_179909.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(1999,'2021-09-01 07:44:43','2021-09-01 07:44:43','Macropropagation of Mindoro pine (Pinus merkusiii Jungh and de Vriese) using shoot tip cuttings and needle fascicles.','2021-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Geva&Atilde;&plusmn;a, Dixon T.','forest management$zNueva Vizcaya, Community development, equity; tenure$xforest management',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/PCR-11-0087_ab_180662.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(2000,'2021-09-01 07:44:43','2021-09-01 07:44:43','Assessment of integrated solid waste management preparedness: the case of Silliman University.','2021-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Jimenez, Juanito P.

The two isolates were characterized morphologically under the genus of Metarhizium. Sequence analysis of the ITS-5.8s rDNA region using ITS1, ITS2, ITS4, and ITS5 primers showed higher homology to <em>Metarhizium flavoviride</em> var. flavoviride (AY646398.1) compared to <em>Beauveria bassiana</em> and <em>Paecilomyces sp</em>. The two isolates were found pathogenic to 7 day-old larvae of <em>H. armigera</em>. Larval mortalities were observed on various levels of fungal concentrations from 104 to 108 conidia ml-1. LC50 values of IPLB-1 and IPLB-2 isolates at seven days after application were 3.290 x 105 and 3.737 x 105, respectively. Studies on its virulence and effectivity to different larval instars of <em>H. armigera</em>, among many, are necessary to determine the potential of these entomopathogenic fungi as biological control agents.

Some relevant factors were considered in the development such as the problems encountered by the farmers with the existing furnace as well as environmental considerations. The parts of the furnace such as the screw conveyor, the reactor, the thickness of insulation, the ash collector were designed with theoretical basis. The technical performance of the ricehull-fueled furnace was evaluated in terms of thermal efficiency, combustion efficiency, thermal output, and fuel consumption rate. A single factor experiment in Completely Randomized Design (CRD) was used in the evaluation. The sole factor for evaluation was the blower inlet opening at three levels, namely; the 600, 450, and 300. Gas emission test was also performed to quantify the emitted amount of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen monoxide (NO), nitrogen compounds (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) from the furnace. The economic performance of the furnace was also evaluated in terms of net present worth (NPW), internal rate of return (IRR), benefit-cost ratio (BCR) and payback period. Results showed that the furnace is environment-friendly due to lower CO, NO, NOx, and SO2 emissions which are below the maximum permissible amount set under Republic Act 8749 also known as the â€œClean Air Actâ€. Moreover, investment of the furnace was found to be justifiable due to its promising economic indicators <br />',NULL,NULL,'Baradas, Faustina C.','CALAMUS FILISPADIX, SWIETENIA MACROPHYLLA, PLANT RESPONSE, FERTILIZATION, MULCHING, WATERING, Forestry',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/PCR-12-0075_ab_250295.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(2010,'2021-09-01 07:44:43','2021-09-01 07:44:43','An improved artificial diet for life history and bioassay of the Philippine population of eggplant fruit and shoot borer, <em>Leucinodes orbonalis </em>guenee (Lepidoptera: pyralidae)','1980-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Battad, Elizabeth M.','FRESHWATER MOLLUSCS, CARP, POLYCULTURE, Fisheries',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/PCR-12-0090_ab_251250.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(2011,'2021-09-01 07:44:43','2021-09-01 07:44:43','Essential oils research and development program','1996-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'de Guzman, Constancio C.','',NULL,15,9,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2012,'2021-09-01 07:44:43','2021-09-01 07:44:43','A profile of visitors / users of selected national parks and recreational areas in the Philippines','1981-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Calanog, Lope A./Llamas, Yolanda P.','',NULL,15,9,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2013,'2021-09-01 07:44:43','2021-09-01 07:44:43','Resource inventory and assessment of biodiversity in the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority Area','1998-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Fernando, Edwino S./Balatibat, Juancho B.','',NULL,15,9,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2014,'2021-09-01 07:44:43','2021-09-01 07:44:43','Phenology of indigenous forestation species in Region 6','1995-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Uriarte, Nicolas S./Marquez, Conrado','',NULL,15,9,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2015,'2021-09-01 07:44:43','2021-09-01 07:44:43','Effect of narrow-row spacing and population density on the yield of soybean','1985-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Perdido, Visitacion Z.','',NULL,15,9,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2016,'2021-09-01 07:44:43','2021-09-01 07:44:43','Production and utilization of bamboos at the barangay level - study no. 2 : production of decorative bamboos','1982-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Virtucio, Felizardo D.','',NULL,15,9,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2017,'2021-09-01 07:44:43','2021-09-01 07:44:43','Production and management of two (2) commercially important forest vines for basketwares and Christmas decor industry','1997-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Agustin A.

which has high potential for food. To assess the genetic diversity of the plant, germplasm materials were assembled from four provinces in Northern Luzon and characterization was done at MMSU, Batac City using morphological and cytological descriptors. Since the plant remains unidentified taxonomically, its taxonomic identity was established using the 18 natural populations and the taxonomic key designed for local yams. Based on 100 morphological characters, the &ldquo;buga&rdquo; sample showed high diversity using Shannon Weaver&rsquo;s diversity index. The qualitative and quantitative characters equally contributed to the high variability. &ldquo;Buga&rdquo; showed higher variability than D. alata and D. esculenta which were collected from the same regions in the Philippines. Among the putative relatives in the genus, &ldquo;buga&rdquo; exhibited the greatest similarity to D. esculenta as revealed in the multivariate analysis. Procedures on chromosome counting were not sufficient to allow cytological characterization. Within the existing collection, there was no duplicate identified. Expanding the collection by acquisition from provinces unrepresented in the collection is needed. Following the taxonomic key, &ldquo;buga&rdquo; is identified as Dioscorea esculenta (Lour.) Burkill subsp. spinosa Antonio et al. comb. et stat. nov. (ined). The results of the taxonomic identification and multivariate analysis agree with and support each other.

Majority of the seedlings spread from 0 to 20 m from the mother tree. The data also showed that kalantas were distributed between 164 to 480 m asl. Further, the higher the altitude, the more kalantas were found. The highest number of seedlings was recorded at elevation near 480 asl while the highest number of trees and saplings was recorded in Zone 2 with 34 individuals. The plot with the highest percent organic matter had the most number of seedlings while Zone 2 with 60 ppm phosphorus had the highest number of kalantas trees and saplings. The TWINSPAN analysis revealed that kalantas is associated with bagtikan, mabunot and magabuyo, and strongly associated with tambalau.

Reduction in shoot biomass, fruit weight and total fruit biomass were observed in both tomato varieties as response to water deficit where reduction was least at 50 kPA tension level. Whereas water deficit increased water use efficiency of fresh market variety, the harvest index of both varieties was not significantly affected. Significant increases in fruit firmness, total soluble solids, titratable acidity and ascorbic acid content of fresh market variety were observed whereas the response of processing variety differed. Fruit firmness did not vary in processing variety while significant reduction in total soluble solids was observed at 200 kPA tension level. Increase in titratable acidity of processing variety was observed at 50 kPA and 100 kPA tension levels. Water deficit significantly reduced fruit water content and improved fruit shape of the processing variety but not the fresh market variety. Inoculation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fingi, in general, did not show significant effect on the different parameters measured. Results of the study showed that amount of water applied can be reduced by exposing the tomato plants to 50 kPA water tension during fruit set with minimal effect on growth and yield.

Pigs were distributed to four treatment groups following a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement in CRD. Two factors involved were level of copra meal (20/25% in grower and 30/35% in finisher) and ÃŸ-galactomannanase supplementation (with or without). Results of digestibility trial of grower stage showed no significant differences in CODDM , CODCF, CODEE, CODGE, and DE among treatments. Increased copra meal level in the diet resulted into significantly decreased CODCP (P<0.05). On the other hand, ÃŸ-galactomannanase supplementation significantly increased CODCP (P<0.05). highest CODCP was observed in treatment with 20% copra meal plus ÃŸ-galactomannanase. At finisher stage, significant interaction effect (P<0.01) of copra meal level and ÃŸ-galactomannanase supplementation was observed for CODEE.

Length per sub-subplot was 4 meters with 1-m buffer per treatment. The findings revealed that the average height and diameter growth of <em>J. curcas</em> hedgerow were enhanced by higher pruning height (P1) having 124.89 cm and 5.5 cm, respectively. The low pruning height (P2) had only an average height of 84.89 cm and diameter of 4.9 cm. Fertilizer application on the alley crops also promoted height increment and sprout formation on <em>J. curcas</em> hedgerows having 112 - 113 cm and 3.5 - 4, respectively. The unfertilized alley plot had only an average height of 88.9 cm and average number of sprout at 3.25. The yield performance of alley crop was improved with fertilizer applications.

Observation showed improvement of the soil chemical and physical properties of the site especially during the second cropping where the contour hedgerows have stabilized. Findings revealed that <em>J. curcas</em> hedgerow had the potential of preventing sheet erosion in a sloping farmland having a soil accumulation ranging from 23.09 ton ha<sup>-1</sup> to 36.51 ton ha<sup>-1</sup> while the no hedge plot had a soil loss of 24.32 ton ha<sup>-1</sup>. Soil accumulation was also observed to be higher if <em>J. curcas</em> pruning is applied as mulch with 37.63 ton ha<sup>-1</sup> while the plot with no mulching application had only 20.88 ton ha<sup>-1</sup>. Economic analysis showed that the use of <sup>J. curcas</sup> hedgerows in an alley cropping system is capable of providing profit to the farmers.

Vulnerability determinants and adaptive coping mechanisms/strategies toward these impacts were determined. A total of 361 respondents from five direct impact study sites were randomly selected and analyzed to determine the cause-and-effect relationship among variables. The conceptual framework of the study provided a checklist of important issues and other factors that links to each other; draws attention to core influences and processes; and determine the critical determinants and interactions between the various factors that affect the individuals, households, and communities. Households and communities have low awareness and consciousness of the natural resources (i.e., air, water, land, and biodiversity) of the watershed. High level of social vulnerability was due to lack of knowledge on tenure system, basic needs of the family, and susceptibility to hazards that greatly affect their well being, which the respondents felt that was very inadequate/not sufficient to support their life condition. Respondentâ€™s low and negative attitudes toward impacts of environmental changes in the watershed had negative net effect on social and economic, environmental, and physical attributes. The extent of biophysical vulnerability revealed high negative impacts on people and community, implying need for measures to be institutionalized to mitigate the impacts of environmental changes. The various coping mechanisms identified were community and kinship ties; conservation, protection and rehabilitation measures; adaptation strategies for livelihood program; and public hearing and consultation on the problems, issues, and concerns in the watershed. The findings and empirical data generated a new construct in the theories and concepts of vulnerability in the form of a model of community vulnerability index. The community vulnerability index is a function of social, economic, and biophysical attributes toward impacts of significant environmental changes in the watershed. The significant socio-demographic determinants of community vulnerability were education, number of children in school, residence in the area, and household size; and for social psychological behaviors were awareness, perception, attitudes, and shared perception of impacts of environmental changes. <br /><br />',NULL,NULL,'Agbisit, Richard T.','THEOBROMA CACAO, CACAO, SEEDLINGS, PLANT SOIL RELATIONS, PLANT WATER RELATIONS, SHADING, GROWTH, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2150,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','Yield and quality of toddy from tall and dwarf varieites of coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) as influenced by inflorescence morpho-anatomy and season','2021-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Azucena, Vivian A.','Manihot esculenta, cassava, biochemistry, protein',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2151,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','Genetic diversity and fumonisin analyses of Fusarium verticilliodes (Sacc.)

Using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) â€“ based technique, 49 of the 53 isolates were identified as F. verticillioides with an amplified product of 800 bp in size using VERT-1 and VERT-2 primers. Of these, 39 isolates were fumonisin-producers as exhibited by single fragment of 400 bp using VERTF-1/VERTF-2 primers. This assay which utilizes primers derived from the intergenic spacer (IGS) sequence of F. verticillioides isolate A0999, showed considerable specificity since <em>F. verticillioides</em> tester strains were amplified with VERT-1/VERT-2 and VERTF-1/VERTF-2, but not <em>F. proliferatum </em>and<em> F. subglutinans</em> tester strains. Using Universally Primed-PCR (UP-PCR) markers,<em> F. verticillioides</em> and <em>F. fujikuroi</em> populations were grouped based on geographical origin and species as supported by intermediate to high bootstrap values. Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) cluster analysis with Jaccardâ€™s coefficient showed that similarities among isolates within <em>F. verticillioides</em> were intermediate to high ranging from 57.9 to 97.5% and resolved five major groups at 71% similarity level. Some <em>F. verticillioides</em> and <em>F. fujikuroi</em> isolates were associated with each other in the phylogenetic tree that could probably be attributed to the high nucleotide similarities of both species. The effect of crude toxins of selected high and low fumonisin-producing isolates of <em>F. verticillioides</em> and <em>F. fujikuroi</em> on the germination and root length of rice and corn seeds/seedlings was analyzed. The extent of inhibition of germination and root length of both crops was not associated with fumonisin-producing ability of <em>F. verticillioides</em> and <em>F. fujikuroi</em>. This experiment suggested that the inherent capacity of each isolate to produce toxins is independent on their relative ability to cause substantial effects on a particular crop. <br />',NULL,NULL,'Baguio, Synan S.','artificial insemination, semen characterization, chicken, Gallus gallus domesticus, semen preservation',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2152,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','Information and communication technology (ICT) utilization by end-users of selected agricultural research and extension networks in the Philippines','1980-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Agpaoa, Alfredo C.','LEUCAENA LEUCOCEPHALA, SOWING, SURVIVAL, PHOSPHORUS, RHIZOBIUM, GRASSLANDS, Forestry',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2153,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','Development, evaluation and optimization of a microcontroller-based mechanical coffee roaster for small-scale roasting','2021-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Acosta, Joseph E.','rice$xfield performance$zLos Banos, Laguna, Oryza sativa, aerobic rice$xcrop management, aerobic rice$xwater management, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2154,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','A distributed intelligent agent-based system framework for PCARRD research and development (R&D) proposal submission and evaluation','1997-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Agua, Marius M.','WATERSHEDS, RUNOFF, EROSION, FORECASTING',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2155,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','Survival and growth responses of three tree species to mycorrhiza and fertilizers in the bioremediation of a mine waste dump','1978-09-01','The sub-marginal condition and the cost of rehabilitation deter most of the mine spoil rehabilitation efforts.

Event-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and chi-square goodness-of-fit test showed that the cry1Ac follows a 1:1 segregation ratio in three successive generations of backcross-derived populations: BC1F1, BC2F1 and BC3F1. Two BC1F2 populations which were direct descendants of BC1F1 showed a 3:1 segregation ratio for the gene. The observed segregation ratios followed the expected Mendelian ratios for a single gene, indicating that the gene segregates according to Mendelâ€™s laws of inheritance and is integrated in a nuclear chromosome which establishes stability of transmission of the cry1Ac gene in Mara x Mahyco EE-1 and DLP x Mahyco EE-1 and derived lines. Cry1Ac protein expression varies temporally as revealed by quantitative ELISA. Cry1Ac protein concentration in terminal leaf tissues of BC2F1 Mara x EE-1 and BC2F1 DLP x EE-1 fluctuated in different stages of growth and development. A significant difference in Cry1Ac protein expression was observed in the two crosses, which emphasizes the importance of parental background in Cry1Ac protein expression. Cry1Ac protein is expressed in terminal leaf, immature fruit, flower, stem and root of field-grown BC3F1 fruit and shoot borer-resistant eggplant. Significant difference was observed in Cry1Ac protein concentration among the plant parts tested. Flowers and terminal leaves showed relatively much higher levels of Cry1Ac protein than in the fruit, stem and roots. Line and variety background differences were also detected for specific plant parts. Cry1Ac concentration that was quantified in various plant parts exceeded the MIC95 value of 0.059 ppm which was identified in baseline studies (Mahyco, 2006). This implies adequate control for the eggplant fruit and shoot borer under field conditions. The results also imply that selection will be effective in the development of subsequent lines. The study on protein expression show that Cry1Ac protein is expressed constitutively and it varies in developmental stages and plant parts of field-grown fruit and shoot borer-resistant eggplant in the Philippines. <br /><br />',NULL,NULL,'Caccam, Mabel M.','sericulture$xfarming systems$zIlocos Province, agroecosystems',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2160,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','Callus induction and assessment of anthocyanin and betalain in In Vitro cultures of maranth species (Amaranthus spp.)','1979-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Alava, Veronica R.','PENAEUS MONODON, PRAWNS, NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS, PROTEINS, Fisheries',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2161,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','Growth, yield and functional components of pummelo [Citrus maxima (Burm. ex Rumph.)

Ex Rumph.) Merr.] trees.  The experiment was conducted at South Davao Corporation (SODACO) farm, Davao city from April to September 2010. Five treatments with increasing K levels were applied per tree: control, no K, 150 g K basal, 225 g K basal, and 225 g K basal + foliar application. The vegetative growth of pummelo was not affected by increasing K rates. The recommended rate (150g K basal per tree) significantly increased canopy diameter by 76% but higher K rates did not increase tree height due to the effect of fruit load and nutrient competition. On the other hand, increasing K rates to 50% of the recommended rate (225 g K per tree) increased the number of flushes by 36-146%. Flowering, fruit set and yield of pummelo were also enhanced by higher K rates. Flowering was increased by 4 times, fruit set by 86-117%, fruit number by 7 times, weight per fruit by 22-26%, and yields up to 9 times on trees applied with 225 g K rates.  The fruit size (diameter and length), however, did not increase by increasing the K level. Application of 225 g K rates also positively influenced fruit quality and functional components of pummelo. Fruit pulp diameter increased by 36% while peel thickness decreased by 29-75%.  An increase of 39% juice weight per fruit was obtained in 150 g K only; however, the yield of juice per tree increased up to 11 times with 225 g K level.  The 225 g K rates also increased juice pH by 8-12%, titrable acidity (TA) and total soluble solids (TSS) per tree by 9 times and 6 times, respectively. The yield of total phenol, flavonoid, vitamin C and oil per tree increased by 3-10 times with 225 g K application. The effects of basal alone and foliar + basal application of K were only significantly different from each other in terms of number of flushes, fruits that set, juice and flavonoid yield per tree. On the other hand, the application of 225 g K basal + foliar resulted to higher number of flowers, % fruit set, number of fruits, fruit weight, yield, TA, TSS, total phenol, vitamin C and oil yield per tree in pummelo, implying a higher mobilization of K in the leaves than K uptake by the roots. The results of the study indicated the important role of K in improving the yield, quality and functional components in â€˜Magallanesâ€™ pummelo. The critical stage of tree growth coincided with the months of May and August. Peak leaf flushing occurred in June and peak flowering with fruit set in April. The crucial stage of fruit development was two months after fruit set. Thus, optimum fertilization must be applied during these stages for maximum growth and production in pummelo.',NULL,NULL,'Catibog, Noel A.','coconut$xgenetic diversity$zEastern Samar, In situ conservation$xcoconut, putative wild-type coconut',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2162,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','Assessment of sustainability of two watershed projects in Southern Mindanao, Philippines','1982-09-01','The study sought to assess the sustainability of two watershed projects in Southern Mindanao in terms of their cost-effectiveness, equity, project acceptability, ecological stability and organizational maturity. Data were gathered from 132 farmers consisting of 78 respondents from Saug watershed and 54 respondents from Kilagding watershed. Other data came from official reports of the government agencies concerned, interviews, group discussions and field observations and laboratory results. The demographic characteristics of the two communities occupying the said watersheds were almost similar in terms of age, civil status, household size, tribe, educational attainment, annual gross income, and farm size. They differed only in gender as there were more male respondents in Saug than in Kilagding. Farm tenure differed also in both sites. In Saug, the entire watershed project area was classified as permanent forestland; therefore, the People Organization was issued a Community-Based Forest Management Agreement (CBFMA). In Kilagding, the project area was divided into two categories: titled lands within alienable and disposable land and permanent forestland which was also covered with a CBFMA. Results showed that Saug watershed project was cost effective because it accomplished more than its target without any additional cost. The existence of benefit sharing scheme, income generating projects, equal job opportunities for each PO member made the project equitable and acceptable to the project participants. The increased vegetation within the CBFM area with a responsible, organized and functional PO were the signs of ecologically stable and organized and mature PO, having a bright future as a sustainable watershed project. Kilagding was also found as cost-effective because it accomplished its physical target area for development with a minimum cost. In fact, the cost of the labor counterpart of the project participants was more than the combined project funds spent by UDP and LGU Laak. Kilagding was equitable since all the participants had the equal opportunity to learn and participate in the learning farm where they belong. The UDP project was acceptable to the project participants as evidenced by their high attendance to meetings and other project activities. The increased in vegetation and the adoption and establishment of soil and water conservation (SWC) measures helped in the stability of the area especially that more farmers were adopting this kind of farming in their individual farms.

General Luna, a part of Siargao Island Protected Landscape and Seascape (SIPLAS), is one of the world class surfing destinations in the Philippines, and coastal tourism is starting to be a major industry. Pressures of tourism and activities of local communities on the state of the coastal water quality, coral reef cover and sea grass and impacts on ecosystem services of tourist destinations were assessed. Semi-structured survey questionnaires were used in the interview of the local community, tourists and resorts and accommodation operators. Heads of offices involved in coastal tourism and SIPLAS were also interviewed. Coastal water of the beach used for recreation is within Class SA of DENR water quality standard. The diverse coral reef is in fair condition and recovering from damage of illegal fishing activities. Sea grass beds in the coastal areas are diverse in species but slightly silted due to human activities in the adjacent build up areas. Despite General Luna being a part of SIPLAS, government and private sectors involved in the industry have adopted limited sustainable management practices of the Global Sustainable Tourism. Although the tourists were satisfied with the cultural ecosystem services, foreign tourists identified insufficient health and absence of bank services as problems. Local community has positive attitude towards coastal tourism, but local environmental governance is inadequate to educate and encourage the people to participate in the protection and conservation of the coastal resources for sustainable tourism.

A total of 162 college faculty of agriculture from Benguet State University (BSU), University of the Philippines Los BaÃ±os (UPLB), Visayas State University (VSU) and Central Mindanao University (CMU) participated in the study representing four of the countryâ€™s Super Regions. The universities did not significantly differ in terms of knowledge transfer performance and MA competency. They were on â€œOn the Roadâ€ to a focus on personal information and KM. Organizational culture, technology, human resources, political influence and age significantly influenced the organizationsâ€™ knowledge transfer performance. The factors that significantly affect knowledge assets were organizational culture, people/human resources, technology, political influence, and post doctoral field of discipline. Meanwhile, field of discipline, organizational culture, organizational structure, technology and gender significantly influenced the competency of teachers to integrate the multifunctional agriculture concept in their subjects. Conclusions drawn from the study point to the importance of initiating a more holistic KM program among schools and mandating that agricultural schools develop and implement an MA curriculum plan. <br />',NULL,NULL,'Alipit, Percival B.','SOLANUM TUBEROSUM, SOIL WATER CONTENT, NITROGEN POTASSIUM FERTILIZERS, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2165,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','Fertilizer reduction in hybrid rice (Oryza sativa L.) through increased nutrient use efficiency.','2021-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Decena, Anna Lynn A.','Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2166,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','Effect of supplementing high aflatoxin diets with toxin binder (TB) or herbal liver conditioner (HLC) alone or in combination on the performance of broilers.','1997-09-01','A study was conducted to determine the effect of supplementing high aflatoxin diets with toxin binder (TB) or herbal liver conditioner (HLC) alone or in combination on the performance of broilers. A total of 400 straight-run day-old broiler chicks (Cobb 500) were randomly distributed to five (5) treatments following a complete randomized design. The dietary treatments consisted of: T1 = basal diets with low aflatoxin; T2 = basal diets with high aflatoxin; T3 = Treatment 2 + TB; T4 =Treatment 2 + HLC and; T5 = Treatment 2 + TB and HLC. The broilers were fed with their respective diets for 35 days. Results showed that high aflatoxin diets did not significantly affect the COD of crude fat and AME but significantly reduced the COD of crude protein relative to the diets with low aflatoxin. Supplementation of the diet with HLC significantly improved COD of crude protein relative to the unsupplemented diet with high aflatoxin. Feeding high aflatoxin diet significantly increased feed consumption of the broilers relative to those fed low aflatoxin diet. Supplementation of high aflatoxin diet with HLC significantly decreased body weight gain and feed consumption of the broilers relative to those fed unsuppplemented diet with high aflatoxin. Combination of TB and HLC significantly reduced the depressing effect of HLC on body weight gain and feed consumption of the broilers. Feeding high aflatoxin diet and its supplementation with TB or HLC alone or in combination did not significantly affect the feed efficiency, livability, immune response of broilers against ND vaccine at 7, 14 and 21 days after revaccination, dressing percentage and relative percentages of liver, gizzard and heart of the broilers. High aflatoxin diet adversely affected the normal structures of liver and kidney of broilers relative to those fed diet with low aflatoxin. Supplementation of high aflatoxin diet with combination of TB and HLC minimized the liver damage but none of the feed additives used were able to ameliorate the combined effects of aflatoxin and ochratoxin on the kidney of broilers. Feeding diet with high aflatoxin markedly decreased IOFCC however, its supplementation with TB or combination of TB and HLC minimized the adverse effect of aflatoxin on IOFCC of the broilers. Supplementation of the diet with TB is effective in counteracting the adverse effect of high aflatoxin on the performance and profitability of broiler production, whereas, HLC supplementation of high aflatoxin diets did not influence performance and IOFCC. <br /><br />',NULL,NULL,'Alo, Anna Marie P.','GOATS, SHEEP, COCOS NUCIFERA, COMMUNICATION, DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, SUSTAINABILITY',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2167,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','Effects of supplementing diets with amino acid chelates of copper, zinc, manganese and iron on the performance of broilers.','1980-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Alocilja, Evangeline C.','SOIL FERTILITY, RICE, NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY, ZINC, PHOSPHATE FERTILIZERS, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2168,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','Carbon sequestration by faraon and adtuyon soils under different cropping and tillage systems in Zamboanga Peninsula','2021-09-01','This study is focused on tillage and cropping systems effects on sequestered soil organic carbon (SOC) in Faraon and Adtuyon soils of Zamboanga Peninsula. The tillage systems were no-tillage - no plowing/harrowing, vegetative residues retained on the surface, and planting was done in drill slot; conservation tillage - one plowing to 15 cm depth and one harrowing, vegetative residues retained and incorporated; and conventional tillage- two plowings to 15 cm depth and two harrowings with off-baring and hilling up, and vegetative residues removed. The cropping systems were classified as annual cropping-corn, corn-legume rotation, vegetables, and rootcrops; covercrop and forage cropping-calopogonium cover crop, and pasture; and perennial cropping- banana and fruit crops. Results showed that sequestered SOC was higher in no-tillage and in conservation tillage than in conventional tillage at Faraon soil. However, only no-tillage had significantly greater SOC among tillage systems in Adtuyon soil. Likewise, SOC was higher in soils under cover crop, forage, and perennial cropping systems. Generally, tillage systems have significantly affected the sequestered SOC. No-tillage had conserved the carbon stock in soils, while conservation tillage maintained the level of soil carbon. However, conventional tillage system reduced the carbon stock as this type of tillage exposed soils in the elements of weather for more decomposition of soil organic matters. Carbon sequestered by soils through no-tillage farming, conservation tillage, covercrop, forage and permanent cropping systems appeared to have great potential for carbon trading to mitigate climate change. <br /><br /><br /><br />',NULL,NULL,'Dela Cruz, Nenita E.','watershed$xresource management $x sustainability, geographic information system$xsoil erosion, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2169,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','DNA fingerprinting of Philippine bananas and assessment of genetic fidelity of micropropagated \'lakatan\' using simple repeat markers','1981-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Alvaro, Flerida C.','RUBBER, LATEX, CROP YIELD, CLIMATIC CHANGE',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2170,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','Changes in yield of selected vegetables and in soil characteristics of farm undergoing conversion to organic farming','1986-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'America, Leila C.','LIZARDS, LIZARDS, PHILIPPINES, PHILIPPINES, Zoology, Zoology',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2171,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','Use status and risk posed by development to mangrove resources in Sitio Lawis, Punta, Baybay City, Leyte','2021-09-01','The study was conducted from October 2009 to January 2010 in Sitio Lawis, Punta, Baybay, Leyte. The objectives were to determine use status of mangrove resources and to assess the risk factors associated to enlarging population and developments in the mangrove area. Reconnaissance survey was first conducted to have the first impression on the situation in the area and decide the set of data to describe such situation. For the assessment of mangrove resources,Â 12 plots were purposively established overÂ 4 sampling points. The factors considered in selection of plots were the observed mixture of species, relative sizes of trees and zonation. For all trees in the plots, species were identified and then measured for basal diameter, diameter-at-breast height and the total height. Household interview was conducted to determine how residents utilize mangrove resources, what factors contribute to protection of the same resources, assess the history of infrastructure development in the area and assess the socio-demographic profile of the residents. A total of 8 species belonging to 5 families were recorded in the area. Mangrove stands showed influence of cutting but the sizes of sprouts indicated that damage by firewood gathering had been controlled effectively in the past several years. Interview indicated that the prohibition of cutting by the land claimant is a big factor in controlling damage to mangrove. Concerned government officials failed to show visibility in the area as far as monitoring and protection of mangrove resources are concerned. From 2 houses in 1960, the area now has 62. On the average, more than one house was built per year in the last 3 decades. More than half of households asked permission from the land claimant before building a house, others were permitted by local officials while only few got established there through purchase of a house. There was no enlargement in the area covered by house construction. New houses were simply inserted in vacant space between existing ones. As the settlement area became denser lately, few were starting to reclaim tidal flats, an indication of future risk of expanding to sites with trees. The road improvement to the settlement area caused stagnation of sea water that in turn resulted to death of a mangrove stand. It is recommended to institutionalize the constant monitoring in planned structural development that can influence the ecological requirements of mangrove species, such as those that can influence tidal water flow.Â  The influence of land claimant to local residents should be considered in the design of future development projects in the area. <br /><br />',NULL,NULL,'De Leon, Florencio F.

To achieve the objectives, descriptive analysis, problem tree analysis, cost and returns analysis, demand analysis, and statistical analysis were employed. Primary data were obtained from 100 smallhold dairy crossbred buffalo farmers, 12 white cheese processors and 8 private schools using semi-structured questionnaires. Secondary data from government and private agencies were also utilized. Characterization and evaluation of the smallhold dairy crossbred buffalo production and marketing system was done prior to the actual modeling procedure. Results showed that 67% of the animals were crossbreds, 99% of the farmer-respondents practiced extensive type of rearing, 22% supplemented concentrates to the lactating animals, 44% employed cut and carry system and 95% reported low milk yield during dry months. Since all the farmer-respondents considered dairying as their major source of income, majority (71%) hand milk the dam shortly after calving at the expense of the nutritional needs of its nursing calf. Moreover, farmer-respondents (91%) were not involved in navel care management, 62% provided neither housing nor facilities for their animals, 15% practiced calf-feed supplementation and 74% restricted the calf from suckling. Overall, dairy farmer-respondents provided minimal management to the animals particularly to the calf. The focal problem was the farmerâ€™s low income particularly during the dry months concurrent to the low market demand for buffalo milk due to low marketable milk surplus and low milk price. Cost and returns analysis showed a positive net income of Php 118.95 and Php 25.86, per day and per liter, respectively, during the peak production season. The aggregate demand for buffalo milk, 10,284 kg per month of the dairy cooperative, white cheese processors and private schools captured a small portion of the total estimated demand for buffalo milk of the General Trias populace. Other demand estimation methods employed showed that the demand for buffalo milk in 2009 was 119,902, 123,499 and 143,473 kg per month. This was way above the estimated supply of buffalo milk in the locality amounting to 24,974 kg per month only. A bio-economic model revealed that calf management, in terms of pre-pubertal weight gain, influences the future performance of the dairy animals. Strong negative linear relationships were found between cumulative 240-day first lactation milk and pre-pubertal average daily gain at 7 months, 9 months and 10 months of age (P<0.1). Simulation results showed that calves reared under recommended management (RM) tend to have higher first lactation milk yield, higher weights for the entire rearing period, earlier onset of puberty and shorter non-productive life than calves reared under farmerâ€™s practice. A 46.22% increase in buffalo milk supply of the General Trias locality can be achieved if RM practices were employed. <br />',NULL,NULL,'Aniceto, Paulino C.','MUSA TEXTILIS, SEED, GERMINATION, SCARIFICATION, STRATIFICATION, PLANT GROWTH SUBSTANCES',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2174,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','Quantification of the contribution of component technologies of the System of Rice Intensification and PalayCheck to productivity in lowland rice','1981-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Aparra, Teresita L.','CASSAVA, CROP YIELD, AGRONOMIC CHARACTERS, PLANT GROWTH SUBSTANCES, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2175,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','Assessment of seed distribution, dissemination and diffusion pathways of priority tree plantation species in the Philippines.','1979-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Apud, Florentino D.','PENAEUS MONODON, AERATION, GROWTH, SURVIVAL, FISH FARMS, Fisheries',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2176,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','Floral attributes and management practices of public green spaces in two major urban cities of Western Visayas, Philippines.','1993-09-01','<p>The study was conducted in six public green spaces of Bacolod City and Iloilo City from March to December 2009. It aimed to determine the floral attributes and management practices of public green spaces in two major urban cities of Western Visayas. <em>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</em> was the most common tree species in Bacolod City while <em>Swietenia macrophylla</em> was prevalent in Iloilo City. Of the 1,892 woody species in Bacolod City, there were 52 species, 37.25% were exotic, 45 genera, and 26 families. In Iloilo City, there were 563 woody species, comprising 34 species, 70.59% were exotic, 33 genera, and 21 families of trees. Mean stocking was 102.08 stems/ha and 100.25 stems/ha, in Iloilo City and Bacolod City, respectively. Simpson Diversity index was high in the green spaces of Iloilo City and moderately high in Bacolod City. Leaf spot and anthracnose were the most common leaf diseases, while canker and stem rot were common stem diseases. Embedded nails and GI wires were the most common causes of injury of the trees. Overall Tree Condition Rating showed that majority of trees in Pana-ad Park and Stadium and Plaza Libertad belonged to Cass I, Bacolod City Plaza and Jaro Plaza belonged to Class II, Capitol Park and Lagoon and Lapaz Plaza belonged to Class III. <br />Green spaces were managed by different LGUs with only Iloilo City having a centralized office taking charge of all the green spaces. There were no management objectives in all green spaces, limited involvement of NGOs, civic organizations and other volunteer groups in green space management and limited technical capabilities in managing tree resources. Organic matter, P and K were low and CEC was moderately favorable to growth of plants. CEC was significantly higher in Iloilo City than in Bacolod City. Among the soil properties, only BD was correlated with MH and ULCR at 16 to 30 cm depth. Management capabilities and cultural practices were not correlated with OTCR. Carbon stored in biomass was 147.90 t/ha in Iloilo City and 112.99t/ha in Bacolod City. Iloilo City had higher SOC (41.62 t/ha) than Bacolod City (39.89 t/ha) at 0 to 15 cm and at 16 to 30 cm depth with 36.95 t/ha. It is highly recommended that both Bacolod and Iloilo City should expand existing greens spaces, and encourage the planting of native species both indigenous and endemic. Moreover, the two cities need to formulate management plan, strengthen the technical capabilities of greening staff and harness community participation in green space management. <br /><br /></p>',NULL,NULL,'Aquino, Albert P.','COCONUT INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, TAXES, FISCAL POLICIES, PHILIPPINES, Statistics',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2177,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','GIS-aided biophysical characterization and assesment of a landscape in relation to landslide occurrences.','2021-09-01','This study was conducted in the watersheds of St. Bernard, Southern Leyte to <br />determine and identify the major factors influencing landslide occurrences and make recommendations for suitable land use.

Slope Stability Index Mapping (SINMAP) in GIS environment was used to locate areas in the watershed that are prone to landslides. The data inputs to run the model are DEM, location of actual landslide initiation points (7 points; identified using SPOT image-5m resolution taken in 2008, and ASTER image-10 m resolution taken in 2006 which were used as reference in the model) and geotechnical parameters (ex. soil density). Important output from SINMAP is a digital slope stability index (SI) map showing areas that are less prone to landslides (SI values >1) and areas that are susceptible to landslides (SI values <1) or the unstable zones. The unstable zones constitute 33% of the total land area of the watersheds. These are found at the ridges near the fault line and at higher elevation with slope angles > 50o. It is strongly recommended that the unstable zones of the watershed should remain as protected zone and should be planted with trees to enhance slope stability. The research site is mapped as having moderately suitable (38 %) to suitable (59 %) for abaca and & moderately suitable ( 44 %) to suitable (53 %) for coconut production.

Representative towns and barangays were selected from the two geographic zones of the province. Sample clumps were selected in four physiographic locations in each representative barangay. Clump characteristics, including some edaphic and physiographic variables in each sampling location, were measured. Variations in clump characteristics were assessed using analysis of variance, while multiple regression analyses were made to ascertain the variables for predicting shoot, culm and biomass yields of clumps. Clumps in the northern towns (District I) of Ilocos Norte produced taller and stouter culms, taller shoots and higher stem biomass yield than those found in the southern towns (District II). The clumps found in the northern towns of the province are more productive because of higher average annual rainfall, soil OM and K contents. On the other hand, clumps along creeks had the biggest diameter, and the highest culm and biomass yields while those on hilly areas have the smallest diameter, and lowest culm, shoot and biomass yields. Clumps along creeks have better yields due to the interrelationships of more favorable site factors such as availability of moisture, moderate slope, lower elevation and better soil characteristics. The multiple regression analysis showed that clump diameter is an important factor in predicting the shoot, culm and biomass yields of natural stands of kawayan tinik. In addition, the edaphic and physiographic factors (like aspect, slope, elevation, and soil pH, OM, P and K) helped improved the equations for estimating the yield of the stands. The information on the location of more productive stands can be used as basis in crafting management schemes for kawayan tinik in the province. For instance, rehabilitation of old stands along creeks can be prioritized since these clumps are more productive and could help meet the current and projected demand for poles and shoots. On the other hand, the developed equations can be used in estimating the shoot, culm and biomass yields of natural kawayan tinik stands growing on the various physiographic locations in Ilocos Norte. <br /><br />',NULL,NULL,'Mojica, Ruel M.','coffee roaster',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2181,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','Natural artificial regenerations in the rock dump site of abandoned mining area in Larap, Jose Panganiban, Camarines Norte, Philippines.','1982-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Aquino, Lolita V.','TILAPIA NILOTICA, CAGE CULTURE, Fisheries',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2182,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','Soil fertility and land suitability assessments of the different abaca growing areas in Leyte, Philippines.','1985-09-01','This study was conducted to assess the soil fertility status and land suitability of the different abaca growing areas of Leyte. Preliminary investigation has been done to establish relationships between growth parameters and biomass or yield of abaca which was the basis in the actual field sampling. Brief description of the sampling areas, agro-climatic data, and topographic parameters were recorded. Soil samples were collected and analyzed for the different soil fertility indicators such as pH, %OC, Avail. P, Exch. Bases (K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+), Extr. Acidity (Al3+ & H+), Extr. Micro-nutrients (Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn), and CEC. These parameters were used in the soil fertility and land suitability assessment of the different sampling areas. The approaches used in the soil fertility assessment include Soil Fertility Index (SFI) and Soil Fertility Capability Classification (FCC). Soil pH, Available P, Exchangeable K, Exchangeable Ca, Extractable Cu, Extractable Zn and Extractable Fe were considered as MSFI for the different abaca-based production systems. With these indicators, samples collected in Cagang, Polahongon, Mahaplag (Site No. 13) was found to be high in soil pH that resulted to high availability of Ca in contrast to the samples collected from Tongonan, Kanangga (Site No. 01). Relationship of the identified MSFIâ€™s revealed that, Avail. P (exponential), Exch. K (sigmoidal), Soil pH (i.e. quadratic), Ca, Fe, Cu (i.e. Gaussian) and Zn (logistic) follow different patterns with respect to the biomass production of abaca. Integrated scored value of the MSFIâ€™s showed that Lower Odiong samples of Javier Leyte (Site No. 11) registered the highest SFI value of 8.05 while the lowest SFI was noted in Cabintan sample (Site No. 03). FCC analysis suggests that more than three-fourths (i.e. 80%) of the sampling areas have Sandy soils while the modifiers revealed that acidity(â€œhâ€) is one of the major constraints for abaca production. Land suitability assessment of the sampling areas revealed that only two sites were highly suitable (S1) for abaca production namely: Danao, Ormoc city (Site No. 02) and Odiong, Javier (Site No. 11). Areas which are currently not suitable (N1) for abaca production includes Hibunauan, Buruaen (Site No. 06), Balinsasayaw, Abuyog (Site No. 12), Amguhan, Baybay (Site No. 09), and Tongonan, Kanangga (Site No. 01).

The relationship of Vtg concentration ([Vtg], Âµg Zn dL-1) at these ages were evaluated with laying traits from lay of first egg until 40 weeks of age. The influence of temperature and humidity on selected laying traits was evaluated also as an indirect measure of environment effect on Vtg. A total of 340 ducks aged 12 week old were randomly selected, raised singly in a cage, and fed ration with or without 30ppm supplemental zinc in RCBD. Blood serum samples were collected from all experimental ducks and assayed for Vtg. Measures of selected reproductive parameters were obtained from ducks processed at specified age. The egg production records were collected daily and analyzed for relationship with [Vtg]. Data were statistically tested using PROC GLM, PROC CORR, PROC REG, and PROC NESTED. Results showed that the circulating Vtg in blood serum of ducks at 17 to 22 weeks of age, at sexual maturity, and at 40 weeks of age were 0.65Â±0.10 Âµg Zn dL-1, 0.69Â±0.07 Âµg Zn dL-1, and 1.80Â±1.47 Âµg Zn dL-1, respectively.

On the other hand, changes in [Vtg] in three reproductive periods: at 17 to 22 weeks of age, at sexual maturity, and at 40 weeks of age were a cubic function. There is a significant relationship of Vtg at 17 to 22 weeks of age with body weight and liver weight. Vtg at sexual maturity had no relation with laying traits. At 40 weeks of age, high circulating Vtg was positively correlated with early maturity, large body weight, longer laying duration and pause length, and lower hen-day rate egg production. The low circulating Vtg was observed in late maturing, smaller body weight, shorter laying duration and pause length, and higher hen-day rate egg production. There is a significant relationship of temperature with total eggs produced, hen-day rate egg production, and occurrence of soft-shelled eggs, shell-less eggs and double-yolked eggs. The relative humidity and temperature-humidity index did not influence the laying traits. Results of these studies showed that the circulating Vtg follows a dynamic pattern common in all organisms depending on biochemical, physiological, and metabolic requirements and utilization.

Philippine forests typically contain high C density (up to 500 t/ha). Studies on carbon have drawn global attention due to the issue of climate change. Though the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) prescribed default values and allometric equations in estimating biomass for national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories, it encourages all countries to come up with estimates that reflect the local status of the forests more accurately. This requires more detailed studies on the carbon stock of the Philippine forests. Likewise, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol is seen as an opportunity for the developing countries to attain sustainable development through access to financial and technical support. This study assess the current carbon stocks in the various ecosystems within Manleluag Spring Protected Landscape (MSPL) e.g., natural forest, plantation forest, agro-ecosystem and brushland/grassland at different elevations: 200m asl, 300m asl and 400m asl. Various carbon pools such as trees, understorey/herbaceous vegetation, roots, litter and soil were considered in the collection of data. The study shows that natural forests stored the highest amount of C estimated at 262.12 tC/ha, followed by plantation forest (185.36 tC/ha), then by agroforests (109.75 tC/ha), and the least was observed in grasslands (73.25 tC/ha). Overall, the mean C density of MSPL is 157.62 tC/ha. About 48-90% of the total forest carbon is tied up in the soil, 9-42% in the aboveground biomass, 1-9% in belowground biomass and 1-1.2% in necromass. Analysis shows that the amount of carbon stock is influenced by the type of vegetation while elevation had no significant effect on the amount of carbon stored for all ecosystem types. The results of the study validated previous reports on biomass and carbon stock in a range of ecosystems in various parts of the country and the region. This study also highlights the use of specific wood density of species in the conversion of volume data to biomass. The data generated from this study provides valuable inputs for possible trade-off of carbon under the CDM and can be used as additional reference for the scientific community in establishing the actual range of biomass and C stock in the forests necessary in developing allometric equation and default values that can be used locally. <br />',NULL,NULL,'Rundina, Cynthia N.','dairy cattle; Bos taurus; Escherichia coli$xveterinary medicine$zLuzon',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2190,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','Biology, pattern of infestation and characteristic damage of the citrus rind borer, Prays endolemma Diakonoff (lepidoptera: yponomeutidae) on pummelo, Citrus maxima (Burm) Merr.

The egg hatched in 3-4 days. The larval period ranged from 13 to 15 days, while the pupal period last for 4-5 days. Eggs were dome-shaped, almost circular (0.051 Â±0.005 mm diam), cloudy white, and laid singly on the fruit surface from fruit set until the fruit measured less than 35 mm diam. The larvae spent the entire five instars inside the rind, particularly in the flavedo, until the fully mature larvae (average length of 5.5 Â± 0.22 mm) crawled out from the fruit. The fifth instar larva was distinct from the younger larvae because the former displayed a pattern of red stripes one on each abdominal tergite extending to the lateral margins. The pupa was 4.5 Â± 0.5 mm. long and was enclosed in a lacelike, large-meshed cocoon. The adult was generally grayish brown with dark brown markings and measured an average of 4.05 Â± 0.605 mm (ÂÅ ) and 4.75 Â± 0.69 mm (Ââ€°) long. The female genitalia showed a distinct ductus bursae with short tubular upper third and sclerotized wide lower part formed of two broad sclerites (cestum), bearing each a dentate ridge from where the species got her name. Twelve days after flower bud formation, 42% of the labeled buds showed damage by CRB and ultimately dropped to the ground while 58% of the buds developed into fruits but were subsequently infested by CRB before they reached the size of less than 35 mm diam. Only 32% of the damaged fruits reached maturity and were harvested. The feeding or larval tunnels were 4-8 mm in length and were confined to the flavedo, just beneath the exocarp. A fruit could support as many as 11 larvae in different stages of development. This could be translated into a series of four egg layings in one fruit developmental period: one from bud formation until fruit set and three during early fruit development. Predation of CRB larvae by a spider (Araneae: Salticidae) and by black ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) were observed in the field.

Currently, <em>Antherostele</em> species are threatened and categorized by the DENR (2007) under vulnerable status. Since its establishment as a separate genus from <em>Urophyllum </em>Wall. on the basis of morphology (Bremekamp, 1940a), <em>Antherostele</em> has not been challenged by any molecular study to test its monophyly and determine its placement within Rubiaceae. Furthermore, the genus and species descriptions provided by Bremekamp (1940a) are incomplete, especially the reproductive features, due to limited herbarium material. To address these gaps, sequences of the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region (nrDNA) were utilized for phylogenetic analysis and morphological descriptions of freshly collected specimens were performed. Parsimony and Bayesian analyses of the ITS data show that <em>Antherostele</em> is monophyletic and is nested within the tribe Urophylleae of subfamily Rubioideae. The genus is united by apomorphies such as hairy corolla lobes and syngenesious stamens. <em>Antherostele</em> is hypothesized to originate from montane regions in Luzon and diversified by forming larger leaves following dispersal to the shaded forest understory. The montane <em>A. luzoniensis</em> (Merr.) Bremek. is found to be sister taxon to the rest of <em>Antherostele</em> species. The present study confirms the segregation of <em>Antherostele</em> from <em>Urophyllum</em> and its placement within Urophylleae as proposed by Bremekamp (1940a) and Robbrecht (1988), respectively.

The study was carried out in the macro-somatic clonal nursery of the Ecosystems Research and Development Division in Maharlika, Bislig City. A 2 x 2 x 2x 4 factorial experiment in Split-Split-Split Plot Design (SSPD) with three replications was used in the study. Method of propagation was assigned as main-plot factor: close mist (M1) and open mist (M2); type of species: <em>C. inophyllum</em> (Bitaog) (S1) and <em>P. pinnata</em> (Bani) (S2) as sub-plot factor; kind of rooting hormone with two levels: Indole-butyric Acid [IBA] (H1) and Naphthalene Acetic Acid [NAA] (H2) as sub-sub plot factor; and the levels of rooting hormones with four levels: control [no hormone application] (C1), 300ppm (C2), 600 ppm (C3) and 900 ppm (C4), as sub-sub-sub plot factor. Data gathered were analyzed using Analysis of Variance and Least Significant Difference Test. Open mist propagation is effective for rooting <em>C. inophyllum</em> and <em>P. pinnata</em> cuttings as it gave statistically higher number of adventitious roots, longer length of roots, and higher rooting percentage. <em>C. inophyllum</em> cuttings exhibit statistically higher rooting percentage compared to <em>P. pinnata</em> cuttings when subjected to open mist method and treated with 600 ppm of NAA.Â  In terms of number and length of roots, and rooting percentage produced NAAÂ was more effective than IBA. However, levels of hormone concentration were not generally effective on the rooting performance and shoot production of both species. The study recommends that open mist method of propagation should be used for <em>C. inophyllum</em> and <em>P. pinnata</em> utilizing young stock plants to ensure better rooting performance. Both species should be treated with 600 ppm of NAA to enhance higher rooting percentage for <em>C. inophyllum</em> and to produce greater number and length of roots for <em>P. pinnata</em>. <br /><br /></p>',NULL,NULL,'Salamanca, Jeanny C.','rice$xhybrid varieties, rice$xmorpho-agronomic characters$xgrain physical characters',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2197,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','Growth and productivity of lowland rice (Oryza sativa L.) under different meteorological conditions imposed by varying the dates of planting in Agusan del Norte, Philippines','1980-09-01','Changing the seasonal cropping calendar to avoid heavy rainfall, floods and low <br />solar radiation is being considered for improving rice (<em>Oryza sativa</em> L.) productivity in Agusan del Norte, Philippines. An experiment was conducted to determine the growth and productivity of lowland rice grown under different meteorological conditions imposed by varying the dates of planting. Four lowland rice varieties: PSB Rc82, NSIC Rc146, NSIC Rc122 and PSB Rc18 were grown in six different planting dates such as the early or regular planting dates (Jan. 15 and 30) and late plantings dates (Feb. 14 and 28; Mar. 15 and 30). For early planting dates, high amount of total rainfall during the vegetative stage resulted in less tillering, decreased leaf area index (LAI) and dry matter yield (DMY), while high amount of cumulative solar radiation (CSR) and cumulative temperatures (CTemp) enhanced the growth parameters. In the later dates of planting (Feb.14 to Mar. 30), high CSR did not result in high grain yields as shown by low DMY, sink size (SS), solar radiation-use efficiency (SRUE), and harvest index (HI). The growth and yield-determining parameters that significantly contributed to grain yields of rice grown in six planting dates were: filled grains per panicle, total spikelets per panicle and HI. Parameters such as panicles per m2 and 1000-grain weight had minimal contribution to the improvement of grain yield. Declining grain yields in the later planting dates could also be attributed to negating effect of high CTmax as CSR increases. When total pest damage due to rodents, WSB, ShB and BLB were added in the set of factors, the contributions of meteorological elements were overridden by such factors. Although pest management was improved using PalayCheckTM guidelines, damages caused by pests and diseases were apparent in the very early and late plantings. Intermittent rainshowers and sunny period coupled with high relative humidity and favorable temperature encouraged pest build-up. Among the six planting dates, regular plantingÂ on Jan.30 produced highest grain yields (5.4-6.7 t ha-1) for all varieties, and surpassed the target grain yield of 5 t ha-1 by 8- 26%. High grain yields were associated with high crop growth rate (CGR) and net assimilation rate (NAR) and solar-radiation use efficiency (SRUE) due to more number of spikelets per panicle and filled grains per panicle, reflecting greater SS, grain filling, DMY and HI. The meteorological conditions in this planting date could be considered optimum for rice crop growth due to declining amount of rainfall towards reproductive stage (106.8 mm) and maturity (40.9 mm), optimum CSR from vegetative to maturity of 919.0 MJ m-2, and favorable mean air temperatures of 27.3-29.0 <sup>o</sup>C. With the regular planting dates (Jan. 15 and 30), CSR had the greatest contribution to grain yield (R2=56**). Among the varieties, PSB Rc18 was the best performing variety, having the consistently high grain yields (5.23-6.69 t ha-1) across different planting dates, and being the only variety that surpassed the target yield ( 5 t ha-1) by 0.23-1.59 t ha-1 in all planting dates due to wide-range of adaptability and tolerance to pest infestation. On the other hand, varieties such as PSB Rc82, NSIC Rc146, and NSIC Rc122 performed when planted during the regular planting dates. <br />',NULL,NULL,'Aypa, Simeona M.','MUSSELS, GROWTH RATE, Fisheries',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2198,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','Flood vulnerability analysis for the towns of Mabitac and Santa Maria, Laguna, Philippines','1981-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Bacusmo, Jose L.','SWEET POTATOES, CROP YIELD, PLANT ANATOMY, AGRONOMIC CHARACTERS, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2199,'2021-09-01 07:44:44','2021-09-01 07:44:44','Drying and storage characteristics of golden apple snail (Pomacea spp.).','2021-09-01','Drying and storage characteristics of golden apple snail (GAS) as a non conventional food, fertilizer and feedstuff were established in this study.

Using the determined nutrient values, least-cost layer diet containing either QPM or NM was formulated to contain the same amount of nutrients. The dietary formulations were randomly assigned to 144 layers (24 weeks of age) with six replications of 12 layers each. Feeding period was 16 weeks. The effects of feeding the diets on egg production, egg quality and economics of production were assessed. The QPM contained 29.41% more crude protein, and 8.44% more crude fat than NM. Its crude fiber, nitrogen-free extract, and crude ash contents were lower by 5.06%, 3.01%, and 34.30% than NM, respectively. The QPM had 22.96% more total amino acids than NM.

The apparent metabolizable energy (AME) of QPM was 3,353 kcal/kg and 3,336 kcal/kg for NM while the true metabolizable energy (TME) was 3,578 kcal/kg for QPM and 3,533 kcal/kg for NM; differences were insignificant. Layers fed QPM based diet produced as much eggs, with same egg mass and feed efficiency as those fed NM based diet; there were tendencies though that the former had consistently higher values than the latter for these parameters in the first six weeks of the feeding trial.

The nectar contained high amount of sugars, phenols, flavonoids, anthocyanidins and saponins. Alkaloids were absent while anti-oxidant activity was present. The pollen grains were simple and numerous with high viability of 91.16 Â± 4.11 %. The germination rate of pollen grains using differential sucrose solutions was low at 64.65 Â± 9.53 %. Majority of the pollen had moderate amounts of starch (62.23 %) and lipids (70.61 %). Only three pollinator visits were needed for effective pollen deposition. Pollination was through entomophily with pollen and nectar as rewards. Floral visitors were 22 insect species belonging to 15 families and 5 genera. <em>Apis mellifera</em>, <em>Apis cerana</em> and <em>Trigona biroi</em> were the most frequent visitors but only <em>A. mellifera </em>and<em> A. cerana</em> were considered as the true pollinators. <br />Pollen viability and germination, stigmatic receptivity, nectar production and floral visitation were all found to be significantly highest at 0800h.

One hundred S1 families were generated from Population 62, a flint white QPM and Population 63, a dent white QPM. They were planted in IPB Experimental Station, UPLB and CMU, Musuan, Bukidnon. Only field data for CMU was analyzed since UPLB site was affected by typhoon. Analysis of quality traits was done, however, in UPLB. Genetic variance component among S1â€™s revealed significant difference for most of the traits studied. Genetic coefficient of variability and broad sense heritability were found to be high in almost all the agronomic and quality traits. However, estimates of error variance were greater than their respective genetic variance counterparts for stand count, shelling percentage, ear length, and yield than their genetic variance counterparts in Population 62 and stand count, plant height, ear length, and ear diameter in Population 63. The bias due to GxE might have been confounded in the error term. Significant genetic variability for amylose, amylopectin and starch content of two QPM Populations was found. This finding is important since they account for the nutritional and taste quality of corn as food. Traits correlation analysis showed higher values for genotypic than phenotypic coefficients. Significant positive phenotypic and genotypic correlations were found between grain yield to plant height, ear height, shelling percentage, ear length, and ear diameter for the two populations. Generally, there was low correlation between agronomic and quality traits. Hence, both traits could be improved simultaneously in these populations: one could be enhanced without necessarily impairing the other. There is apparent sufficient genetic variability present in these two maize populations for flowering, agronomic, yield-related and quality traits. Therefore they are amenable to improvement through recurrent selection â€“ either through intra or inter-population improvement. Outstanding S1â€™s were identified for inclusion in the next cycle of improvement of these two populations. <br />',NULL,NULL,'Capistrano, Ailon Oliver V.','lowland rice$xdrought tolerant, L-proline, Oryza sativa',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2204,'2021-09-01 07:44:45','2021-09-01 07:44:45','Community structure of key tree species in various forest habitats of Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park, Palawan, Philippines.','2021-09-01','The influence of vegetative parameters to tree communities was examined <br />in Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park (PPSRNP) through <br />ordination analysis, which was performed using Canonical Correspondence <br />Analysis (CCA).

Durian test plants at Jocelsâ€™ Farm, Bagontaas, Valencia City were allowed to bear fruits for two seasons from June 2009 to June 2010. Two levels of goat urine application (without and with) as Factor A and seven kinds of organic and inorganic fertilizers (control, recommended 80N-90P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>--10K<sub>2</sub>0, Solubor, Entrag, chicken dung, Vermicast, and Solubor + Entrag) as Factor B were laid out in Factorial arranged in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) replicated three times. It was found that fermented goat urine significantly increased the percent fruit set by 65.06% and 20.19% during the first and second fruiting period compared to the untreated trees. The same treatment increased the number of fruits by 128.21% and 112.06% and consequently fruit yield to 4.03 t/ha or 145.73% and 8.80 t/ha or 84.87% over those trees which were not applied with goat urine during the first and second fruiting periods, respectively. Furthermore, durian trees applied with goat urine showed excellent quality with aril color of almost yellow, strongly detectable aroma, significantly sweeter, higher total soluble solids reading compared to the control and with overall desirability of good to excellent compared to the untreated trees. Trees applied with vermicast consistently gave the highest percent fruit set of 59.73 and 63.15% during the two fruiting periods, respectively. During the second fruiting period, fruit set of trees in this treatment is significantly higher than the rest of the treatments. On the other hand, Solubor with its active ingredient of 20.5% resulted to lowest percent fruit abscission with a mean of 30.83% but did not differ significantly with the treatment applied with Sol+Ent. Entrag which has 34% Ca applied with Solubor (Sol+Ent) significantly resulted to highest fruit yield of 5.14 t/ha or 215.33% over the control during the first fruiting period which increased significantly to 11.8 t/ha during the second fruiting period. Moreover, Solubor consistently resulted in highest total soluble solids of 28.75 <sup>0</sup>Brix and 25.75 <sup>0</sup>Brix during the first and second fruiting periods, respectively, with sweet flavor, buttery and creamy yellow color with overall desirability rating of good signifying a better fruit quality compared to the rest of the treatments. It was also foundÂ that durian trees applied with fermented goat urine produced edible portion which was 13.5% and 3.4% higher compared to untreated trees during the first and second fruiting periods, respectively. Furthermore, durian trees applied with fermented goat urine together with Solubor applied singly or in combination with Entrag significantly produced the highest percent edible portion ranging from 41.64% to 51.78% Significant interaction effects between the two factors revealed that spraying of goat urine 3 times during the growing period at 20/200 liters of water on durian trees applied with Solubor or in combination with Entrag produced the most number of fruits per tree with means of 20.21 to 33.11 fruits per tree in both fruiting period. Consequently, the highest fruit yield was consistently observed from trees treated with goat urine and applied with Solubor + Entrag which yielded to 6.11 t/ha and 13.59 t/ha during the first and second fruiting periods, respectively. The same treatments produced excellent fruits in terms of overall desirability while those applied with Entrag alone and the control was rated as fair. Moreover, Solubor and Entrag applied singly or in combination reduced percent incidence and severity of Phytophthora-dieback disease on durian trees and its effects were enhanced by combined application with fermented goat urine. Results further revealed that application of goat urine in combination with Solubor + Entrag consistently resulted in highest profitability with ROI of 222.25% and 560.89% during first and second fruiting periods, respectively. <br />',NULL,NULL,'Balanay, Nicomedes M.

Biological variation among the PRSV 2010 isolates was found based on differences in disease onset, incidence at early stage of infection, symptom severity and virus level in plants inoculated with each virus isolate. Disease onset occurred earlier at 1wpi in plants inoculated with the Laguna 2010 isolate while later at 2 wpi with the Bulacan isolate. Incidence of PRSV infection in plants inoculated with each of the PRSV 2010 isolates was significantly different at early stages of infection only (1 and 2 wpi) but not at later stages (3-8 wpi). The Bulacan 2010 or the Laguna 2010 isolates induced more severe symptoms than the Cavite 2010 isolate.

Two-month old papaya seedlings were mechanically inoculated with each of three PRSV isolates; PRSV Laguna 2010 field isolate, purified PRSV Laguna 2005 and purified PRSV Laguna 2010. The development of infection in inoculated plants of the tolerant varieties was compared with that of the susceptible variety, Davao Solo and Cavite Special and infection was assessed weekly after inoculation for a period of 8 weeks. Cariflora had delayed onset, reduced rate of disease development, reduced disease incidence and reduced symptom severity while Sinta had delayed onset and reduced symptom severity only when inoculated with PRSV Laguna 2010 field isolate. Disease incidence in Cariflora was significantly lower than Sinta, Cavite Special and Davao Solo. Sinta had delayed onset and reduced symptom severity when inoculated with purified PRSV Laguna 2005 but not with purified PRSV Laguna 2010 isolate. Red Lady had disease onset and symptom severity similar to Davao Solo when inoculated with either purified PRSV Laguna 2005 or 2010 isolates. Cavite Special had delayed disease development when inoculated with purified PRSV Laguna 2005 isolate. At later stages of infection, no difference in incidence among the four varieties was observed when plants were inoculated with either purified PRSV Laguna 2005 or 2010 isolates.

Among the three genetic groups, the average observed and effective number of alleles ranges from 2.238 to 2.714 and 1.565 to 1.934, respectively. Likewise, the average observed and expected heterozygosity ranges from 0.297 to 0.432 and 0.308 to 0.422, respectively. The average polymorphism information content extends from 0.303 to 0.414. The average within population inbreeding estimate among the three genetic groups of mallard ducks is -0.0020 while total inbreeding estimate is 0.1292. On the other hand, the measurement of population differentiation has a value of 0.1309.

This study was conducted to standardize the processing parameters to inhibit browning in the product as affected by variety (AES Jak 1 and AES Jak 2) and sulfite levels (0, 0.1, 0.2 %w/w and a control). Physico-chemical properties, functional components analysis, sensory evaluation and microbial quality evaluation were investigated on the fresh varieties and dehydrated jackfruit after processing. The two best treatments (lowest DB) were identified in each variety and stored for four months. The physico-chemical properties, microbial quality and functional components were monitored every two months and the sensory qualities were monitored every month. Physico-chemical, functional components analyses and sensory intensities scores revealed that AES Jak 1 and AES Jak 2 had significant difference in most of the parameters studied. This significant difference can affect the behavior of each variety once treated, dried and stored. Correlation analysis showed that browning in dehydrated jackfruit is strongly correlated with pH and TTA. A negative correlation was observed that is as pH and TTA increase, degree of browning (DB) decreases. These two parameters, TTA and pH can significantly influence browning and can explain the variability by 64 and 50%, respectively. These factors can be used as a method of control in browning. Results further revealed that browning can be minimized with storage using sulfite either 0.1 or 0.2% w/w. AES Jak 1 is more suitable in dehydration process since it is less sensitive to browning due to non enzymatic browning. Sulfite treatment showed reduction in microbial count which resulted to the stability of the product thereby increasing the shelf life. <br />',NULL,NULL,'Bucao, Dioniio S.','Geology',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2212,'2021-09-01 07:44:45','2021-09-01 07:44:45','Review of the Philippine long-horned beetles of the genus Callimetopus Blanchard (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae: Lamiinae: Pteropliini).','2021-09-01','Nineteen species were covered namely: <em>Callimetopus variolosa, C. longicollis, C. longior, C. ruficollis, C. ornatus, C. nigritarsis, C. laterivitta, C. albata, C. palawanus, C. latemaculata, C. mesoleuca, C irrorata, C. capito</em> and six additional species suspected to be new, namely: <em>C. cretumus, C. niveuseta, C. acerdentibus, C. pectoris, C. mindorensis, </em>and<em> C. stanleyi</em>.

Results showed that roosters having red plumage with various shades of laced color pattern, red earlobes, and yellow shank; and, hens having brown plumage with black pencilling color pattern, red with white earlobes, and slate shank were dominant in the region. Raisers observed that these chickens had tolerance to warmer environment, low feed quality, limited supplemental feeds, and parasites but prone to colder environment and occurrences of NCD and CRD. Chickens in Capiz had highest (P<0.05) clutch size; Antique had longest (P<0.05) clutch interval and consistently highest (P<0.01) in survival rate; Aklan had highest (P<0.05) hatching percentage; Guimaras had heaviest (P<0.01) egg, one-day old, slaughter, and adult liveweight; Iloilo had highest (P<0.01) yolk and albumen ratio and heaviest (P<0.01) body weight at eight and twelve weeks old; and Negros Occidental had youngest (P<0.01) slaughter age. Chickens raised in backyard production systems had higher (P<0.05) migration rate and lower (P<0.05) genetic differentiation.

On average, the length of the pellets from the two species, with and without the <br />addition of a binder, did not exceed twice the pellet diameter. For <em>B. blumeana</em>, the <br />pellets from the nodes were longer than from the internodes, and the addition of a binder improved the pellet length of both materials. <em>S. diffusum</em> produced pellets that were about the same in length as <em>B. blumeana</em>, and addition of cassava starch enhanced the fuel pellet length as well. The average particle density obtained for <em>B. blumeana</em> nodes was 0.48 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>which slightly improved to 0.50 g/cm<sup>3</sup> with binder addition. These values were slightly higher than those from the <em>B. blumeana</em> internode pellets, with and without binders. The particle density of <em>S. diffusum</em> pellets, with and without binders, was comparable with the <em>B. blumeana</em> node pellets. In terms of bulk density, best results were obtained for <em>B. blumeana</em> nodes at 229 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, which significantly improved to 267 kg/m<sup>3</sup> when cassava starch was added. The bulk density from the internode portion had a much lower value, which was not comparable to the node portion even with binder addition. The particle density of <em>S. diffusum</em> pellets, with and without binder, was slightly lower than the corresponding pellets from <em>B. blumeana</em> nodes. In terms of durability, all pellets <br />except those from <em>B. blumeana</em>Â internode without binder, achieved a 90% rating. The highest durability rating of 95.8% was obtained from pellets derived from <em>B. blumeana</em> nodes with cassava starch. Durability rating for all materials significantly improved with binder addition. From among the materials tested, the most consistent in terms of desirable physical properties for fuel pellets were those produced from <em>B. blumeana</em> nodes. However, only the durability value of the pellets from the nodes with binder addition surpassed existing standards for pellets. Because of the high ash content of <em>B. blumeana</em>, the use of the fuel pellets may be further restricted to residential consumers. The limitations in the pelletizing equipment used could explain the less than favorable values obtained for the <br />pellets produced in the study. <br />',NULL,NULL,'Banlawe, Nilo V.','MULTIPLE CROPPING, EROSION, SLOPING LAND, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2215,'2021-09-01 07:44:45','2021-09-01 07:44:45','Structure and plant diversity of successional vegetation on ultramafic soils in Southern Palawan, Philippines.','2021-09-01','Extensive forest inventory was conducted in forest on ultramafic soils within the <br />mining tenement of NNMDC, Calategas, Narra, Palawan. One 1-ha plot was established each in the sedgeland, second-growth and old-growth forests to study their structure, plant diversity, and associated environment. All plants with dbh â‰¥ 3 cm were marked, identified, measured and mapped. A total of 123 species of vascular plants belonging to 57 familes were identified in the three 1-ha plots. The vegetation of the sedgeland was homogenous dominated by <em>Machaerina disticha</em>. The vegetation in the second-growth forest was heterogenous dominated by seedlings and saplings and the population densities of the different life forms were dynamic. The common tree species found in the second-growth forest were <br /><em>Dehaasia palawanensis, Terminalia pellucida </em>and<em> Dillenia monantha.</em> On the other <br />hand, two communities were present in the old-growth forest, namely: Gymnostoma and Xanthostemon communities. The dominant species in each community were <br /><em>Gymnostoma nobile </em>and<em> Xanthostemon speciosus</em>, respectively. The total basal area was 0.06 m2 ha-1 for the sedgeland, 0.56 m2 ha-1 for the second-growth forest and 21.8 m2 ha-1 for the old-growth forest. Species diversity was highest in the old-growth forest with an index of 2.59 for the tree stratum while species diversity was highest in the second growth forest with an index of 3.06 for the undergrowth stratum. In general, the ultramafic soils have low %NPK and high concentrations of heavy metals ranging from 6,159.1-10,124.7 ppm for Ni, 3,168.2-9,173.9 ppm for Cr and 286.6- 627.2 ppm for Cu. In addition, the old-growth forest had low values on bulk density (0.61 g/cm3), soil temperature (74.0Â°F), and soil pH (5.6) but had high values on soil moisture (26.1%) and organic matter (6.4%). The associated environmental factors were relatively stable in the old-growth forest than in the two plots established in the mined-out areas. The pioneer and dominant species (e.g. <em>Machaerina disticha, Scleria scrobiculata, Dehaasia palawanensis, Terminalia pellucida</em>) commonly found for each vegetation may be potential reforestation species for the mined-out areas in Southern Palawan. One possible way to rehabilitate a mined-out area is to mimic the colonization pattern of these pioneer and dominant species.Â <br /><br /><br />',NULL,NULL,'Rivera, Ma.

Using Perlâ€™s Prussian blue staining method, expression of OsYSL2 in the embryo and endosperm, where storage proteins and minerals accumulate, revealed varying blue color intensity indicating the importance of OsYSL2 as transporter gene for long distance transport during grain filling particularly for iron translocation to the endosperm. Moreover, Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) analysis revealed that iron content was increased in the polished rice seed of regenerated T0 transformants compared with the wild type. Between the two promoters, OsTRXhp generated a much higher value of iron content in polished rice grains ranging from 4.7 to 7.3 mg/kg than OsSUT1 with iron content values ranging from 3.1 to 6.0 mg/kg. These findings established preliminary evidences that OsYSL2 transporter gene played a vital role in the long distance transport and accumulation of iron in grains. The development of rice line with increased iron content in rice grains offered another milestone or opportunity to address iron deficiency in humans.

Study II, determined the influence of feeding least-cost formulated diet containing QPM or NM under commercial farm condition on the growth performance, carcass yield and composition, sensory attributes of pork and economics of feeding. A total of 16 pigs (Duroc-Pietrain x Landrace) with a mean body weight of 15.47Â±0.23 kg allocated to the type of maize with four replications were used for this study. The QPM had higher amount of crude protein and crude fat but lower in crude ash, crude fiber and nitrogen free extract than NM, respectively. Both essential and non-essential amino acids were higher in QPM. The Gross Energy (GE) and Apparent Metabolizable Energy (AME) of NM and QPM were comparable. The PER and EER for both maize were also similar. The growth performance was comparable for pigs fed diet with QPM or NM; although feed intake of the former tended to be lower than the latter during the finishing stage and for all feeding periods. There were no significant differences on carcass yield and composition of pigs fed the test diets. Sensory scores for tenderness and juiciness were higher for pork from the QPM-based diet than from the NM-based diet. <br />The income over feed cost did not differ despite the lower cost of QPM-based diet. The gross income was higher by PhP 94.50 for NM than QPM based diet due to numerically higher mean liveweight of the former than the latter.

A total of 210 day old Cobb broilers chicks were randomly allocated to six treatments with five replicates. The treatments were distributed following a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) in a 2x3 factorial arrangement with seven birds per replicate. Factor A were the two periods of restriction: third and fourth week of age, factor B were the levels of feed restriction namely: ad libitum feeding, 20% less and 40% levels of restriction. The result showed that feed restriction influenced the body weight, gain in weight, feed consumption, FCR and water consumption parameters but did not affect the livability and percent dressing recovery of the birds. The final body weight of the broilers on 20% restriction was comparable with that of the full fed birds but significantly higher than birds at 40% level of restriction. Moreover, regardless of restriction period those broilers restricted at 40% level showed the highest gain in weight on their refeeding period (5th week).Furthermore, the 40% restricted fed birds showed significantly better (P<0.01) feed conversion ratio over the full fed and the 20% restricted fed birds during the refeeding but did not significantly differ in their overall FCR. Significant interaction was observed during 3rd week of restriction for water consumption parameter with the 40% restricted fed birds having significantly (P<0.01) the lowest water intake.

This work describes the gene structure, derived amino acid sequence, structural homologies, and developmental expression profile of cocosin. Two full-length cocosin cDNA isoforms were isolated through the PCR cloning strategy coupled with 5â€™ and 3â€™- RACE technologies. The open reading frames of CnCos-1 and CnCos-2 both span 1,401 nucleotides, which code for 466 amino acid residues. The two isoforms are 92.3 and 91.5% identical in terms of cDNA and amino acid sequences, respectively. The derived amino acid sequences of cocosin exhibit significant homology with 11S globulins/glutelins of various seed plants. The first 30 residues of CnCos-1 and CnCos-2 correspond to a signal peptide responsible for targeting cocosin into storage vacuoles. The highly conserved asparaginyl splice site is present in both isoforms and divides the polypeptides into acidic (32 kDa) and basic (21 kDa) subunits. The highly conserved bicupin domain and four cysteine residues involved in disulfide bonding among 11S globulins were mapped in both isoforms. Cocosin is methionine-rich as compared to most angiosperm legumins. Cocosin is not a potential allergen as it does not exhibit substantial identity with any immunodominant epitopes of 11S globulins <br />implicated in food allergies. Phylogenetic analysis showed that cocosin is more <br />closely related to Elaeis guineensis glutelin, both of which form a distinct clade in <br />the tree between the divergent clades of dicot and cereal 11S globulins. Relative PCR using actin as internal control showed that the synthesis of cocosin transcripts started at 6â€“7 months after pollination (MAP). The level of cocosin transcripts increased dramatically at 7â€“8 MAP, and slightly increased further at 8â€“9 MAP. Polyclonal antibodies against cocosin were raised in white rabbits and used as probes in the immunodetection of cocosin. The antibodies were shown to be highly specific to cocosin through the Ouchterlony Assay and ELISA. Western blot analysis showed that approximately 4.5% of total cocosin was present at 6-7 months after pollination (MAP) and this increased gradually, reaching 45% at 10â€“11 MAP.

Significant lower temperature were registered on the compost (30% Browns + 30% Greens + 50% Banana Bract) applied with commercial effective microorganism (EM) from five to eight weeks of composting than those applied with fermented activators and tap water. Such is a sign of earlier maturity. Meanwhile, application of Fermented Swamp Cabbage Juice alone improved the percent recovery of compost by 0.36 times (46.70%) compared to those applied with tap water only (34.33%). Furthermore, application of commercial EM and Fermented Swamp Cabbage Juice alone improved the nutrient contents (N, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and K<sub>2</sub>O) of the compost after four and eight weeks of composting. For six weeks, however, tap water was enough to improve the percent nitrogen and phosphorus contents.

Primary data were obtained through interviews with farmers using an interview guide, key informant interview, and focus group discussion and secondary data from records and documents. Simple statistical tools such as mean, frequency, and percentages were employed to analyze the primary data collected in interviews.Results revealed that most of the farmer-respondents are beyond their prime of life with majority of them having spent half of their lifetime to rice and vegetable farming. Their farm management practices were characterized by heavy dependence on inorganic fertilizers and synthetic chemicals for pest and diseases control. The concept of climate change is relatively new to many respondents. Only a few respondents were found fully aware of the concept of climate change. Some of the respondents who formerly claimed to have no knowledge about the concept of climate change were actually aware of its causes.For the farmersâ€™ perception on the climate today compared to 10-30 years ago, majority of the respondents observed that the weather today became warmer and the average temperature increased over time. A significant number of the farmers identified delayed rainfall with rains becoming unpredictable and shorter in duration. In other words, rainfall levels had decreased. Others perceived the annual rainfall to have increased while some said the annual rainfall then and now was the same. Notable stories or accounts shared by the selected farmer-respondents were described and recounted in this study. Farmers who perceived that climate had changed over the years made at least one adaptation primarily to adjust in their farming practices. These were grouped into three, each consisting of certain adaptation strategies, as follows: Crop management adaptation strategies: irrigation techniques, planting appropriate crops for the season, use of improved seeds, shifting planting and harvesting dates, adjustment of chemical inputs,  and rice and non-rice cropping pattern associated with non-farming activities; Solid waste, soil and water management/conservation adaptation strategies, such as  non-burning of agricultural wastes, organic farming through the use of organic materials and organic pesticides, mulching; and other management adaptation strategies such as planting trees.Most of the farmersâ€™ adaptation strategies were not significantly related to their socio-economic characteristics.

The PSUs were formed by joining and linking adjacent barangays within each municipality such that a PSU consists of at least 100 HBLOs rearing carabao.  Out of 849 barangays, 137 PSUs were formed.   The formation of PSUs resulted to relatively homogenous sampling units in terms of carabao related characteristics, while strengthening the correlation between cattle and goat characteristics.  Swine related characteristics remained least correlated with the other types of livestock.  Different sampling exercises on the selection of PSUs were performed to determine the sampling design that will produce estimators of total livestock inventories within the desired precision of CV = 10% and within the sampling rate of 0.25.  The most appropriate Master Sample Design for livestock surveys in Nueva Ecija, specifically for the household based subpopulation, is a one-staged stratified random sampling design of at least 25% (34) sample PSUs, HBLOs within sample PSUs completely enumerated, and where PSU stratification is based on livestock concentration, specifically of cattle and swine inventory.',NULL,NULL,'Bautista, Eugenia N.','AGROFORESTRY, SOCIAL FORESTRY, INNOVATION ADOPTION, STATISTICAL METHODS, Forestry',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2230,'2021-09-01 07:44:45','2021-09-01 07:44:45','Varietal adaptability, weed control approaches and predominant weeds in carrots.','1986-09-01','Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the suitability of six carrot varieties and compare different weed control approaches in the crop under Benguet conditions.

In a drum experiment, water use was lower at 50 cm than at 20 cm water table depth. At 50 cm depth throughout the growing period of mungbean, soybean and corn, adequate moisture was provided for maximum grain and green corn yield. The 20 cm depth had higher available moisture but had poor aeration, which impaired crop growth. The water use, yield and yield components of mungbean, soybean and corn were significantly reduced at 80 cm water table depth due to moisture stress. However, this depth provided adequate moisture for maximum yield of cowpea. In another drum experiment, an even rate of increase in water table depth from 60 cm at planting to 90 cm at harvest provided adequate moisture for cowpea. The soil moisture profile at the different growth stages of the crop was not markedly different  with that of a constant water table of 60 cm. Water use and grain yield of cowpea were significantly reduced when the water table depth was evenly increased to 120 cm. There was a significant reduction in water use, yield and yield components at 90 cm water depth. Under field condition, planting time with reference to initial water table depth and planting depth markedly affected the available moisture, root density and crop performance of mungbean, cowpea, soybean and corn. Higher available moisture at the initial water table depth of 60 cm favored the growth and yield of corn and soybean. The corn and soybean yields at an initial water table depth of  60 cm  and planting depth of 15 cm was at maximum. The yield of cowpea at 90 cm initial water table depth with 10 and 15 cm planting depth below the 10-cm furrow was comparable to 60 cm initial water table depth at any planting depth. Mungbean yield was high at 80 cm initial water table depth with 15 cm planting depth below the 10-cm furrow. Later plantings with deeper water table significantly reduced crop yield. The field experiment confirmed the result of the greenhouse studies. Root density and water extraction by cowpea in another field experiment were enhanced by the application of nitrogen and phosphorous either at 15 or 30 kg P2O5/ha in combination with 15 or 30 kg N/ha.

The framework consisted of three major steps, namely: (a) needs analysis of the system and potentials of the delivery systems; (b) land-use suitability assessment and (c) land-use decision-making and allocation. As conceptualized and developed, the framework and resulting model considered the temporal, spatial and sectoral dimensions of the regional land-use problem to account for their various dynamic competitive relationships. With these considerations, the model was applied in a study region - the Cagayan Valley.  The process started with needs analysis of the system and potentials of the delivery systems. The land capability classification component of this process classified the biophysical characteristics of land such as slope, elevation and soil type into landscape units. Results of this process was a land capability map of Region II which showed the location and extent of 397 landscape units. The  second major phase was on the land-use suitability assessment of the stratified 397 landscape units. Candidate land uses were identified for each landscape unit and rated based on the ecological requirements of the commodity and the attributes of the landscape unit under consideration. Results of this activity indicated 994 land-use management. The objective functions of the land-use problem as articulated by certain members of the Regional Development Council consisted of (a) maximizing the net present value of agricultural commodities and (b) maximizing the net present value of  forest crops. The optimization component of the model used a multi-objective linear programming model (MOLP) called the Step Method (STEM). The \"best\" compromise solution of the regional land-use problem was obtained using the STEM. Among others, the \"best\" compromise solution indicated the designated land-use for each of the 397 landscape units of Region II, and the inter-provincial and inter-regional flow of the commodities. The results indicated the applicability of the methodology in rationalizing land-use allocation at the regional level.

Two hundred day-old straight-run broiler chicks were group-brooded for one week and chicks were randomly distributed to two dietary treatments following a completely randomized design (CRD). Each treatment was replicated 10 times with 10 birds per replicate. The dietary treatments were the control diet (T1) and control diet plus 1 kg alpha galactosidase per ton of feed (T2). It was found that in-vitro digestion of soybean meal with alpha galactosidase resulted in significant improvement at pH 6.5 (crop) and pH 6.0 (duodenum) compared to soybean meal alone. Results of the feeding trial showed that addition of alpha galactosidase in broiler diets improved (P<0.05) the coefficient of digestibilities of energy and crude protein of the finisher diet.

Pot and laboratory experiments using uncharred and charred poultry litter at levels (10, 20, 30, and 40 g kg-1 soil) were carried out to evaluate their direct and residual effects on the fertility and microbial respiration in acid sandy loam soil. Control, without poultry litter amendment, was included in all experiments. Peanut was used as test plant in pot experiments. At 10 and 20 days of incubation (DOI), a linear trend on direct effects of levels regardless of type of poultry litter ws noted on soil pHh20, organic C (OC), total N, and extractable P. A similar linear increasing trend on exchangeable K, Mg and Na was observed at 20 DOI. Exchangeable Al and acidity on the other hand, significantly decreased with increasing rates of either uncharred (UPL) or charred (CPL) poultry litter. Interaction of types and levels of poultry litter also resulted in significant change on soil pHCaCl2, exchangeable acidity, OC, and total N at 10 DOI but at 20 DOI, significant change was only noted on soil pHcaCl2 and OC. Liming benefit and positive change in total N due to application of different levels of poultry litter were carried over until after second cropping. Regardless of levels, the residual liming  benefit of CPL was superior than UPL even until after second cropping. At 40 g kg-1 soil, significant higher positive residual effects on OC was obtained from CPL application compared to UPL. On the other hand, the positive change in extractable P due to residual effect of CPL application was obtained even at 20 and 30 g kg-1 soil. In general, direct effects of application of uncharred or charred poultry litter resulted in better plant growth, nodulation, biomass, and N and P uptake than the control plants. Direct effects of interaction of types and levels of poultry application were observed on plant height, nodule number and nodule weight. On the other hand, residual effects of interaction of both factors were only observed on the nodule number and shoot dry weight. Irrespective of level of amendment, direct effects of UPL application resulted in greater amount of CO2 evolved than CPL. A similar trend was observed with residual effects of two amendments. The above results indicate that apart from the positive benefit from CPL application on soil fertility, converting raw poultry litter into char may play an important role in reducing C emissions associated with organic matter enhancement practices and increasing C stocks in acid sandy soils.',NULL,NULL,'Dedicatoria, Ranell Martin M.','wildlife$zMt.

Diversity indices were determined using BioDiversity Pro software. Correlation analysis was done between height, diameter, leaf size, diversity against the 12 independent factors from water and peat properties. Ninety-two species belonging to 53 families and 73 genera of vascular plants were recorded. Tristaniopsis micrantha (Myrtaceae) and Thoracostachyum sumatranum (Cypercaeae) are the most dominant species. Results showed that the two other zones, viz. the intermediate forest and sapling-size forest are recognizable between the tall-pole forest and the pygmy forest. The changes in forest structure from the outer to the inner zone are related to increasing peat thickness implying interdependence between the peat thickness and adaptation to the peat physical and hydrological conditions. Such change in structure is influenced by the shallow superficial peat layer and the surface protective layer of the peatland, the acrotelm.',NULL,NULL,'Salisid, Teresa DG.','Forestry, essential oil-producing tree species$xgrowth$xyield$zBukidnon',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/PCR-13-0078_ab_280463.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(2245,'2021-09-01 07:44:45','2021-09-01 07:44:45','Variation of some wood quality indicators in plantation-grown large-leaf mahogany (sweietenia macrophylla King)\r\n','1979-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Calinga, Ronaldo H.','COWPEAS, FARMYARD MANURE, PEST CONTROL, PLANT NEMATODES, Botany',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/TH-00001_ab_355140.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(2246,'2021-09-01 07:44:45','2021-09-01 07:44:45','The sustainability of people-initiated mangrove management system in Banacon Island, Getafe, Bohol','2021-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Samson, Norida P.','Aquaculture, Aquaculture, African catfish$xcatfish, African catfish$xcatfish, induced spawning, induced spawning, follicle-stimulating hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, luteinizing hormone, Marine science, Marine science',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/TH-00003_ab_355115.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(2247,'2021-09-01 07:44:45','2021-09-01 07:44:45','Aspects of the population biology of the brown mussel, modiolus metcalfei (Hanley), in Panguil Bay, Northern Mindanao, with notes on a posible management strategy for the species','2021-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Nanola, Cleto L. jr.','reef fishes$zPhilippines, Marine Science, Marine science',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/TH-00015_ab_355143.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(2248,'2021-09-01 07:44:45','2021-09-01 07:44:45','The leadership of SPCMBY as percieved by fishfarmer cooperators in Sampalok Lake, San Pablo City, Laguna','2021-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Cabrera, Olivia C.','phytoplankton$zBohol, Philippines$zEastern Sulu Sea, biomass, Marine science',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/TH-00016_ab_355148.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(2249,'2021-09-01 07:44:45','2021-09-01 07:44:45','Short-term chronic effects of cadmium and zinc on survival, growth and histopathology of postlarval Penaeus Monodon (Fabricius)','2021-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Avenido, Pedro M.','Fisheries, shrimp$xfeeding, Penaeus monodon, apple mangrove, feed additives',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/TH-00017_ab_355149.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(2250,'2021-09-01 07:44:45','2021-09-01 07:44:45','Growth and gonadal maturation of androgen -

The reciprocal Hybrids 1 (H1) (Mo x Ni and Ni x Mo), the first hybridization, were backcrossed with parental O. mossambicus in reciprocal crosses (i.e. with O. mossambicus as mother or father) to produce the reciprocal Hybrids 2 (H2) (H1 x Mo and Mo x H1), the backcross 1 and reciprocal Hybrids 3 (H3) (H2 x Mo and Mo x H2) and the backcross 2. These reciprocal hybrids and pure parental species were exposed to progressive changes in salinity at 6 ppt intervals until total mortality. Parental O. mossambicus showed the highest salinity tolerance, followed by reciprocal H3, H2 and H1, while parental O. niloticus had the lowest. There was an increase of salinity tolerance in the offspring as they were backcrossed to the saline-tolerant parent O. mossambicus. Maternal inheritance was observed in reciprocal H1 and reciprocal H2, while paternal inheritance was observed in reciprocal H3. H1 had the highest heterosis. Both H2 and H3 stocks had negative and slight positive heterosis, indicating that they are good candidates as base population for selection. Additive inheritance was observed due to their nearly zero heterosis.  Hybrid 1 will not fit as base population for selection due to their high heterosis and aggressive behavior, that might be transmitted in the next generation. Hybrid 3 will not also fit as base population for selection due to the high inbreeding values. Hybrid 2 will best fit as base population for selection due to their low heterosis (additive inheritance), low aggressiveness and zero inbreeding. However, H1 can contribute in the base population for selection, because heterosis is not only governed by dominance-recessive effect but also additive gene effect. H3 can contribute to the base population, due to their high salinitytolerance.',NULL,NULL,'Anonuevo, Ma.

Pathogenicity trials on coconut seedlings using isolated bacterium, fungi and nematodes failed to reproduce the symptoms of the disease. In vivo inoculations also produced negative results. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis likewise eliminated the possible association of a viroid and apparently, virus, to the disease. However, oxytetracycline-HCl injections on trunks of diseased palms apparently delayed disease development. The suspected sensitivity of diseased palms to the injections, therefore, served as a basis for intensifying research on the possible association of mollicutes, not to mention flagellated protozoans to the disease, as in the case of coconut \'lethal yellowing\' and other rickettsiae-implicated meladies.',NULL,NULL,'Briones, Roberto J.','GREEN MANURES, LEGUMES, HERBAGE CROPS, NITROGEN CONTENT, RICE, CROP PERFORMANCE, CROP YIELD, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/TH-00326_ab_54588.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(2268,'2021-09-01 07:44:45','2021-09-01 07:44:45','Impact of participatory communication on the sustainability of the small ruminant/coconut systems project.','1996-09-01','Despite the development planners\' desire for sustainable community changes, there are times when development takes merely a survivable path or even an optimal one. Sustainable changes in communities entails an improvement of four factors - the household economics, the individual competency level, his ecological surroundings, and his social environment. This backdrop led to the determination of the path of change taken by the Small Ruminant/Coconut Systems Project  (SRCSP), a PCARRD-IDRC project on sheep and goats, two years after its completion and phase out from Sta. Cruz, Laguna. More importantly, this led to the evaluation on the impact of the project\'s participatory communication activities on its sustainability. An ethnographic study was used to answer the issues and queries. Specifically, the research employed a triangulated method of in-depth interviews, video/photography, and field audit. Ten SRCSP beneficiaries who were members of the Kamtupa Multi-Purpose Cooperative at project\'s end in 1994, comprised the main set of respondents for the study. The former and existing barangay officials of the six villages in Sta. Cruz, Laguna and the cooperators\' neighbors and the former SRCSP cooperators determined the impact of the project in the communities. The data were subjected to the statistical procedures of SPSS for Windows Release 6.13 to assess the values generated. Mainly, descriptive statistics, frequency distributions and cross tabulations were used to plot the growth of the four main variables studied. Rate of change was used to compare the baseline with existing data. Simple rank-order correlation analyses were employed to get a glimpse of the relationships between participatory communication and the variables. Results showed that SRCSP involved its beneficiaries in all phases of the project and that participation was genuine, occurring as \"Cooperation\". The study likewise noted that SRCSP took a sustainable path of change two years after its phase out from the villages of Sta. Cruz, Laguna. About 72.64% of Project gains was sustained beyond project completion. Over a two year period, the individual competency level, the household economic assets and the ecological integrity improved significantly. However, the social assets decreased by more than 16%. The project\'s participatory communication activities had directly affected the growth of the individual competency level, the economic and the social assets; it indirectly influenced the improvements in the ecological dimension. Thus, because of participatory communication, it can be said, that the project was sustained beyond its termination. This occurred in the midst of a typhoon in November 1995 that destroyed the animal pens of the farmer-cooperators. This study was deemed very significant as it showed why and how the SRCSP and its beneficiary organization, KMPC, succeeded and failed, respectively. Through these lessons, planners are expected to get an idea of the importance of participatory communication on project sustainability. As there is no standard measure in the country nor abroad for determining the sustainability to date, the process employed by the researcher may be useful for future evaluators in assessing similar rural development projects particularly those dealing with livestock. Specifically the sustainability indicators used and recommended may be relevant and appropriate for other evaluators. To an agency like PCARRD, this study determined the facilitators of and problems with development projects such as the SCSP, a crucial step that will enable future projects to utilize the former and avoid the latter. And lastly, this study hopefully served as a necessary insight to practitioners normally of contact with the reality of rural people. The researcher hopes that through this study, practitioners will realize the impact that participatory communication and beneficiary participation, in general, have on a project\'s sustainability.',NULL,NULL,'Cardenas, Danilo C.','FARMLAND, LAND DIVERSION, LAND USE, CAVITE',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2018-05-07-01_ab_54618.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(2269,'2021-09-01 07:44:45','2021-09-01 07:44:45','Growth performance of broilers fed diets with phytogenic additive','2021-09-01','The study was conducted to determine effects of feeding broilers with diet containing phytogenic feed additive (PFA) on growth performance, carcass yield, digestibility of some dry matter (DM) components as well as income over feed cost.

It employed the consumers and producers\' surplus approach in assessing welfare changes as a result of technological change and taxation.  The estimation of the supply function was done econometrically while coefficients derived by past studies were used to construct the demand function. Vertical shifters for technological change and tax were estimated from previous studies. Secondary sources of information were used to provide a profile of the coconut industry and R & D in coconut. Given a market clearing and closed economy framework, the net economic surplus due to R & D ranged from P79M to P97M in real terms. However, a more elastic demand and/or a more inelastic supply curve resulted in a lower economic surplus. No major change in surplus distribution was attributed to technological change because of the parallel supply shift assumption. The imposition of tax effectively reduced benefits derived from technological change. Economic surplus (net of tax) was negative due to a tax policy. However, the society\'s aggregate benefits from tax revenues and technological change may range from P70M to P244M in real terms given various assumptions of supply and demand elasticities and tax rates imposed. Hence, the average rates of return on investment to coconut R & D were 39-48% given a market clearing and closed economy framework. But when additional assumptions on market distortion was considered, rate of return may have been 12-15% if the tax rates imposed was 70% lower. The return on investment to coconut R & D was within acceptable levels  even under regimes of minimum taxation.  However, present and future investments must usher in technological change which could bring about a major reduction in the cost of production, maximize productivity and/or minimize postharvest losses. A more favorable macro-environment could also lead to an increase in the net economic surplus as a result of R & D. This calls for a comprehensive strategy which could minimize the price-taking behavior of farmers, limiting barriers to entry and exit, defining a more conducive market structure, development of physical infrastructure, granting of timely and adequate support services  and techinical assistance from the government and aggressive market development by tapping nontraditional trading partners, and promoting increased domestic consumption for coconut and related products. The negative effects of tax on economic surplus from R & D were clear. The imposition of tax given technological change as a base scenario must result to a larger aggregate benefit to the society, otherwise the industry may opt to rely on technological change to raise economic welfare. The study showed that benefits from technological change depend on the nature of the supply shift, nature of the innovation, elasticities of demand and supply, and the presence/absence of distortionary policies, among others.',NULL,NULL,'Daquiado, Nonilona P.','SOIL FERTILITY, SOIL CHEMICOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES, POTASSIUM, CHLORIDES',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2018-09-10-03_ab_54629.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(2271,'2021-09-01 07:44:45','2021-09-01 07:44:45','Physicochemical properties of carbonated pineapple [<em>Ananas comosus </em>(L.)

Negative amplification on the 2 accessions may suggest for the presence of different BSV sequences not amplifiable by BSV F1/R2 primers. Eight out of 18 banana cultivars were detected with episomal BSV at 3 weeks after drought imposition (WADI) until 8 WADI. At 3 WADI, BSV incidence per genotype ranged from 5.56 to 33.33%. Episomal BSV was most expressed on \'Kluai Namwa\'. At 8 WADI, an increase of BSV incidence was observed ranging from 11.11 to 63.50% with \'Latundan\' as the most expressed episomal BSV. In addition, episomal BSV was expressed on \'Pelipia\' at 8 WADI but not on 3 WADI. Statistical analysis indicated that activation of BSV as influenced by drought occurs only in specific Musa cultivars, whether they have the A, AB or B genome. Under glasshouse condition, drought did not contribute to symptom expression of BSV infection even on episomal BSV-infected plants at 3 and 8 WADI. Multiple sequence alignment of the BSV F1/R2 primer pairs using BLAST to partially identify the amplicons was done. Results revealed that, respectively, BSV F1 and BSV R2 have 80% and 85% sequence homology to BSV-Mys (Mysore). This suggested that the BSV in the banana cultivars, in this study, was closely related to BSV-Mys.',NULL,NULL,'Baylon, Juliana C.','MILKFISH, FISH LARVAE, SURVIVAL, SALINITY, TEMPERATURE RESISTANCE, Zoology',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2018-10-04-01_ab_253633.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(2273,'2021-09-01 07:44:45','2021-09-01 07:44:45','The establishment of minimum thermal processes for canned mango (Mangifera indica Linn) products.','1982-09-01','Thermal resistance studies of the peroxidase enzyme and Byssochlamys fulva, heat penetration measurement and process calculations were performed to establish minimum thermal processes for canned mango (Magnifera indica Linn) scoops and juice.

It also determined the vertical absorption and penetration of the chemicals, their lateral distribution at various levels on the stem, and their possible correlation with stain development. Sap-replacement method was conducted by immediate end-dipping of freshly-cut rattan poles in solutions of either copper chrome arsenate (CCA) or sodium penta-chlorophenate (NaPCP). Dipping method was done on 2-m long freshly-cut rattan poles by submerging them for five minutes in solutions of respective chemicals contained in improvised concrete dipping pit. Untreated poles used for the conventional method were cut into 2 m long, bundled and left lying in the cutting area for ten days. An additional method (i.e., sap-dripping), accomplished by leaving newly-cut culms hanging in the cutting area for ten days, was conducted to determine if this method alone was sufficient to inhibit fungal growth. Data on CCA  retention showed a direct relationship between concentration and retention. Results also showed that sap-replaced poles treated with 6% CCA were completely protected from fungal attack, both under natural infection and in bio-assay test. At 2% CCA concentration, the treated rattan poles were still subject to fungal discoloration. Species of fungi associated with stained rattan poles included two molds, one of which was tentatively identified as belonging to the genus Fusarium. These molds produced hyphae and light-colored spores on cut-ends and bruises as well as on leaf scars on the stem. The hyphae and spores can be easily brushed off. Three more fungal species causing deeply-penetrating black discoloration were isolated and one of these was tentatively identified as a species of Botryodiplodia. This fungus (designated as Type A) produced minute, black, pinprick-like pustules on the stem surface, appearing singly at first but later joined together and formed bigger pustules. The deeply-penetrating hyphae of Botryodipodia were found inter and intracellularly in the parenchyma cells which were penetrated through constriction of the hyphal tip, followed by subsequent enlargement of the hyphal fragment after cell wall penetration had been accomplished. The sap-replacement method of protecting freshly-cut rattan poles against staining fungi was more profitable than the dipping method, as indicated by the benefit-cost ratio (BCR) and the internal rate of return (IRR).',NULL,NULL,'Latonio, Anna Ma.

Specifically, the influence of organic and inorganic fertilizers, watering frequency and mulching treatments on the growth behavior of  the germinants were evaluated. Survival of germinants which ranged from 65.78 to 71.33% was not significantly affected by the treatments. Likewise, height growth increment was not significantly affected by the treatments. Mean height growth increments, 11 months after outplanting ranged from 15.00 to 19.35 cm. In terms of root and stem diameter growth, no significant growth responses were noted among and between treatments. Leaf production, on the other hand, was significantly influenced by the interaction of fertilizer x watering treatments but not by the fertilizer or watering treatment alone. The significant effects of fertilizers on the growth performance of the germinants could be attributed to the probable leaching of inorganic fertilizer due to the heavy precipitation, which prevailed during the experimental period and the slow releasing nature of organic (BIOTAB) fertilizers. Likewise, the levels of fertilizers applied may not be sufficient to significantly influence growth of germinants. On the other hand, the insignificant growth response of the germinants to watering and mulching may indicate that the tagiktik germinants require moisture only in moderate amounts. The mean moisture levels in the control (49.49-56.11%) which prevailed during the experimental period may have already adequately provided the optimum moisture requirements vital for their growth. Generally, growth behavior of the germinants in Blocks I and II were significantly better than Block III. The higher moisture level condition (45.57-56.56%), relative light intensity (18.72-25.62%) and organic matter content (2.41%) may have contributed to the improved growth performance of the germinants in the former blocks. Considering the preliminary results and limitations of the study, no conclusive recommendations can be drawn yet as to the best cultural treatments appropriate for outplanting rattan germinants.

Greenhouse and laboratory experiments were also conducted at the Institute of Plant Breeding, College, Laguna to identify seedling traits associated with drought resistance. The four corn genotypes used differed in their response to water stress treatment. Water stress resulted in the reduction of grain yield. Based on the drought index parameter, corn var XV4 and UPLCA VAR 1 were drought resistant while XVH5 and SUWAN 2 were drought susceptible. The drought susceptible varieties were high yielding under irrigated condition but were most sensitive to soil water deficit. Kernel number was significantly reduced by water stress.  Kernel number was the yield component which highly affected the reduction in grain yield. The differences between genotypes response to water stress were also related to differences in kernel number. The reduction in kernel number was associated with high percent unfilled kernels especially at the tip section of the corn ear. Total leaf area per plant and dry matter production at postflowering stage were strongly correlated with grain yield under drought. It  was speculated that the ability of a plant to maintain high leaf area and produce high dry matter under drought enables a drought resistant plant to sustain kernel growth and development. Grain yield was negatively correlated with anthesis-silking interval but positively correlated with pollen shed duration. Pollen viability was not affected  by water stress treatment. Yield under drought was limited by factors in the female plant affecting silk viability or silk extrusion from the tip of the husk. The drought resistant varieties had low leaf water potential, high leaf area, low shoot dry weight, high root:shoot ratio and high RLWC at seedling stage under condition of water stress. Moreover, drought resistant varieties also showed high root:shoot ratio under PEG-induced stressed condition. Among the screening techniques used to study drought resistance, the determination of root-shoot ratio during the seedling stage and rooting response of corn in PEG solution were suitable for drought resistance. The measurement of water status of the plant like LWP, RLWC and stomatal resistance may also be used to evaluate drought resistance of corn plants at seedling stage. The ideotype of drought resistant corn was characterized as large-tasseled or maintained a long duration of pollen shedding, high leaf area after flowering but had stomatas sensitive to lowering of plant water potential especially at peak transpiration.

The influence of zero tillage and watermanagement on the crop performance and water management was evaluated during the dry season of 2010 at the PhilRice Central Experiment Station. Three crop establishments (tillage x seeding method), namely, zero tillage manualseeding, zero tillage drum seeding, and puddled drum seeding; along with two water management treatments, namely, continuously flooded (CF) and alternate wetting and drying (AWD) were employed. Grain yield was not affected by the establishment method, water management or their interaction and averaged at 6.5 t ha-1. Differences in water productivity based on irrigation (WPI) were highly significant across water management treatments only. The WPI values were 0.60 and 0.93 kg m-3 for CF and AWD, respectively. These values were identical with the water productivity based on input water use since the effect of 2 mm rainfall on the total input water use was negligible. The water productivity based on evapotranspiration wascomparable in CF (0.77 kg m-3) and AWD (0.79 kg m-3). This study demonstrated that zero tillage is a sound alternative to conventional tillage (puddling) in irrigated rice production. Implementing zero tillage with alternate wetting and drying can achieve about 34% irrigation watersavings without significant yield reduction. Moreover, water productivity can be increased by up to 35% through alternate wetting and drying.',NULL,NULL,'Paelmo, Roselyn F.','growth performance, Jatropha curcas$zMt.

Most of the studies on carbon storage and sequestration conducted in the country center on terrestrial ecosystems and agroforestry due to dearth of information on carbon storage of mangrove forest in particular. The study was conducted in an uneven-aged mangrove stand in Nasugbu, Batangas in June 2010. The Belt Transect Method was used in the survey and data collection while carbon density was analyzed using the Automated Carbon Analysis-Mass Spectrometry Continuous Flow Technique.  Findings revealed a very low diversity of the area (average of Hâ€™, 1/D, Dmg, and Nâˆž = 1.25); meanwhile, using Shannon Diversity Index a low diversity category was obtained for overall diversity (Hâ€™ = 2.47) of the area.

This study aimed to assess the risk associated with the effective toxicity of the whole meal against vulnerable organisms and to determine whether the toxicity persists, by means of ecotoxicological bioassays. Eudrilus euginiae, Oryza sativa, Danio rerio, and Pomacea canaliculata were used as representative test organisms for worm survival assay, plant growth assay, fish survival, and snail assay, respectively. Biotoxic assays were conducted using pressed cake samples collected immediately after oil extraction, after 6 months and after 12 month in meal piles exposed to the natural environment. Risk assessment was conducted by the construction of Species Sensitivity Distribution and the estimation of the hazard concentration protecting 95% of all the organisms in the ecosystem, HC5. The relative sensitivity of tested organisms is as follows: plant > snail > fish > worm, with EC50 values from the point estimate of the most sensitive test at 1.89%, 2.45%, 4.56%, and 4.58% meal, respectively. The effective toxicity of J. curcas pressed cake persisted within, at least, six months and served as a natural molluscicide, affected plant growth, fish mortality, and worm survival. The toxicity towards vulnerable organisms was not observed after a year of exposure of the pressed cake in the natural environment, suggesting the occurrence of an effective biodegradation process within a year.

For this study, the weather data generator LARS-WG was used to generate downscaled rainfall data corresponding to the present and future climate scenario according to the projections of the HadCM3 A2 and B1 climate scenarios. The results were then analyzedand compared with historical data to assess the changes in extreme rainfall characteristics. Land use change detection from 1993 to 2001 was conducted and validated to quantify the degree of change and aid in the identification of areas most at risk of flooding inside the watershed. The Rational Method was used to determine the effect of land use change on the rate of flow of the Lapad River at different returnperiods based on historical and projected climate change scenarios. The results obtained in this study illustrate an increasing trend on the amount of total monthly rainfall at the onset of the rainy season, while lesser amount of rains on the summer months. On the other hand, land use analysis revealed a decrease in the area covered with forests, agriculture, and grasslands/open areas whereas there is anincrease in the area covered with infrastructures (built-up) and coconut/mixed plantations.',NULL,NULL,'Bautista, Myrna N.','MILKFISH, LIPIDS, FATTY ACIDS, Food science and technology',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2290,'2021-09-01 07:44:45','2021-09-01 07:44:45','Induction of embryogenic calli and regeneration of two varieties of sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas L.) via somatic embryogenesis','1993-09-01','The study was conducted at the National Abaca Research Center Tissue Culture Laboratory from November 2010 to September 2011 with the following objectives: (1) to determine the most suitable type and concentration of auxin for embryogenic calli induced in VSP6L1 and SP31-20.5 sweetpotato cultivars, (2) to determine the most suitable type of culture medium for regeneration of VSP6L1 and SP31-20.5 sweetpotato cultivars via somatic embryogenesis, and (3) to determine the responses of VSP6L1 and SP31-20.5 sweetpotato cultivars in embryogenic calli induction and plant regeneration via somatic embryogenesis. Based on relatively higher embryogenic callus formation rate, the auxin 2,4-D at concentrations of 0.5 mg l-1 and 1.0 mg l-1 showed the most suitable embryogenic callus induction treatment for variety VSP 6. On the other hand, 4-FAA at concentration 0.5 mg l-1 was the most suitable embryogenic callus induction treatment for NSIC Sp 31. Between the two varieties, VSP 6 responded better to the callus induction treatments. Regeneration of plantlets via somatic embryogenesis was observed in VSP 6 but not in NSIC Sp 31 due to high mortality of embryogenic calli. In VSP 6, plantlet formation time ranged from 36 to 52 days from inoculation in regeneration medium. Embryogenic calli previously induced with 0.5 mg l-1 2,4-D formed cotyledons earlier (40.52 days), had more cotyledonary embryos (83.88% of calli, 3.60 cotyledonary embryos per callus produced) and ultimately, more plantlets (48.33% of calli, 1.68 plantlets per callus) than embryogenic calli previously induced with 1.0 mg l-1 2,4-D. The two groups of embryogenic calli also responded differently to the different hormones in regeneration medium.

Contingent Valuation Method was employed to elicit the willingness-to-pay (WTP) of 220 household-respondents for the improved conservation of LPPCHEA systematically selected within the cities of Las PiÃ±as, ParaÃ±aque and Pasay. Most of the respondents (57%) had positive WTP mainly attributed to non-use value (existence value, option and bequest value). Those that responded â€œnoâ€ (43%) to the WTP question cited high bid amount as their primary reason. As expected, bid price significantly and negatively affected respondentsâ€™ WTP by a factor of 0.95. Educational level and the visit of the respondents to the area also contributed significantly. The mean WTP obtained from the dichotomous choice format was PhP35.00/household/month. The aggregated annual WTP computed was PhP 125 million per year, with a Net Present Value (NPV) of Php 474 million in 5 years. Based on supplementary open-ended WTP question, those who rejected the bid price presented in the dichotomous choice format had actually a mean WTP of PhP10/household/month. Aggregated with the households in the study sites, the annual WTP was PhP36 million with a Net Present Value (NPV) of PhP135.4 million (USD3 million) for 5 years at a discount rate of 10%. To capture the economic benefit provided by the improved conservation of LPPCHEA, the study recommends that a LPPCHEA conservation surcharge be added to the monthly water bill, the conduct of information dissemination and donation campaign, and the imposition of entrance fee. The aggregate WTP value can also be used as input in benefit-cost analysis, and can serve as a guide for better decision making. For further study, valuation of use-value should be done.

It was observed that colonization of O.furnacalis adults started at 5 weeks after planting (WAP). Eggs were observed at 7 WAP. Emergence of first instar larvae began at 8 WAP, and continued until 12 to 13 WAP. Adult emergence took place at 13 to 14 WAP, hence, two sets of O.furnacalis adults may be present in a single cropping season; the first set, from colonization of adults from outfield, and the second set from the actual infestations in the sweet sorghum field. By comparison of relative percentages of stalk borer larval instars among varieties, it was found that NTJ 2 obtained the higher percentages of third instar larvae, which were more damaging due to its behavior of feeding in the stalk until pupation. Larval damage was quantified in terms of tunnel length and width. NTJ 2 had significantly bigger tunnel size of 4.82 cm long and 0.80 cm wide compared to the rest of the varieties. NTJ 2 also obtained a significantly lower Brix value compared to the other varieties, while it was ICSV 700 that had the smaller tunnel size; and ICSR 93034 had the highest Brix value, indicating that these varieties may be focused upon for sweetsorghum cultivation. The systemic activity of recommended insecticides â€“ carbofuran, imidaclopridand thiodicarb â€“ was confirmed. At 48 hours after infestation, carbofuran- and thiodicarbtreated plants obtained larval mortalities of 100% and 96.67%, respectively, while treatment with imidacloprid resulted to 90% dead larvae at 10 days after application. Insecticidal activity of foliar insecticides â€“ methomyl and triazophos - to stalk borer was also confirmed. At 24 hoursafter larval exposure to the insecticides on sweet sorghum plants, methomyl caused 83.33% larval mortality, while triazophos caused 96.67% larval mortality. No significant differences were observed between the two treatments. The fungal isolate Metarhizium flavoviride - IPLB-2 was also tested for pathogenecity on stalk borer. Signs of virulence such as cessation of feeding and mortalities due to fungal infection were observed. However, the fungus existed as latent infection; with mortalities only appeared at 14 days post infection (DPI), and sporulation eventually occurring at 35 DPI. Pathogenicity of IPLB-2 on the stalk borers wasconfirmed, the LC50 of IPLB-2 was at 4.16 x 108 conidia/ml. Sporulation of the fungal isolate was observed at the thoracic and abdominal regions, indicating that the mode ofinfection of IPLB-2 for stalk borer may be through ingestion. Further passage is, therefore, recommended, and may produce more favorable results.',NULL,NULL,'Tuates, Andres M.

Severe symptoms are expressed when two viruses namely; Rice tungrobacilliform virus (RTBV) and Rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV) infect the plant. Rice plants singly infected with RTBV usually show mild yellow to orange discoloration of the leaf tips and stunting. In order to characterize host responses of Taichung Native 1 (TN1), and the backcross line TW16 (BC5F8), resistant to RTBV infection developed by serial backcrosses of the resistant donor cv. Utri Merah (accession number 16682, UM82) to the recurrent parent TN1 at the gene expression level, time course transcriptome changes in RTBV-infected rice plants were examined using a customized 60-mer oligonucleotide microarray system. Changes in gene expression of RTBV-infected plants revealed that the genes for DNA replication, protein synthesizing machinery and energy production in the mitochondrion were activated by RTBV infection while the genes for photosynthesis, chloroplast synthesis and the synthesis of cell wall structures were suppressed in the resistant and susceptible genotypes. The degrees of induction or repression, however, were higher in the susceptible TN1 than in the resistant TW16. Though transcription activity of genes related to host defense systems under hormone signals and gene silencing were activated in both genotypes at a relatively early stage of infection, these seemed to be insufficient to reduce virus accumulation in TN1 in contrast to that of TW16. Observations on the temporal changes in virus concentration, symptom development and transcriptome changes in RTBV infected plants suggest that regulation of gene expression by the host were largely determined by virus accumulation and symptom development through time.',NULL,NULL,'Marges, Marianne B.','copper, zinc, lead, soil analysis$zCalancan Bay, Marinduque, water analysis$zCalancan Bay, Marinduque, water pollution, soil pollution, environmental science, Environmental science',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2297,'2021-09-01 07:44:45','2021-09-01 07:44:45','Stand structure of Tectona philippinensis Benth. & Hook. and associated endomycorrhizal fungi under variable environment and ecosystems in Lobo, Batangas, Philippines','1983-09-01','Critically endangered Tectona philippinensis was investigated to determine structure and associated endomycorrhizas in limestone, agroforestry, and coastal ecosystems under varying microclimate and soil during 2011 dry and wet periods in Lobo, Batangas, Philippines.

Results of laboratory experiments showed that bulk density of freshly granulated cassava ranged from 598 to 633 kg/m3 and from 415 to 472 kg/m3 for dried granulated cassava. Resistance to airflow experiments showed very low pressure drop values of not more than 1 mm at superficial air velocity of 0.3 m/s and bed depth of up to 0.20 m. Particle size distribution showed existing granulating machines produced large variation in particle size and large amount (24 to 35 %) of undesirable small particles (<6 mm). Static and dynamic angle of friction experiments showed that for fresh granulated cassava, values ranged from 21.7 to 36.0 degrees but for dried, it ranged from 22.3 to 27.0 degrees. For the angle of repose, fresh granulated cassava values ranged from 32.0 to 42.4 degrees while for dried, values ranged from 30 to 38.5 degrees. Laboratory drying experiments showed that granulated cassava could be dried at 50 Â°C up to 80 Â°C without gelatinization and hardening of the outer portion of cassava granules. At 80 Â°C and 0.05 m bed depth, drying granulated cassava from initial moisture content of 60 % to final moisture content of 13 % would take 2 to 5 hours depending on particle sizes.

Citronella oil spray at 0.25% delayed peel color development. Lemongrass oil vapor at 0.5 and 1% concentration effectively retained firmness in fruits though at higher concentration, lemongrass oil was considered phytotoxic to sweetpepper fruits leading to quality deterioration. Lemongrass oil vapor at 0.25% and 0.5% citronella vapor reduced loss in weight of fruits. Fruits vaporized with 1% lemongrass oil favored high disease severity index.

Specifically, this study sought to identify the area distribution of different landscape elements constituting AWR; analyzethe landscape pattern in AWR at landscape and class levels; and determine the relationship between landscape variables and population density and distribution of C. cebuensis.Three land use/land cover classes were identified within the AWR area, namely: a) cultivated areas (45%); b) forest lands (40%); and c) build-up areas (15%).The estimatedpopulation density of C. cebuensis in mixed strata was 52 individuals per hectare; while it was 53 individuals per hectare in natural strata. There were four forest habitat patches of varying conditions remain in the watershed area. Results showed that patches at class and landscape level had increasing patch shape complexity and irregularity, as well as were highly fragmented with increasing degree of landscape heterogeneity. In regression analysis with 25 and 10 explanatory variables used to predict the behavior of the population density of C. cebuensis (response variables) both at the landscape and sampling site level. There are only three out of 25 and four out of 11 have able to predict or explain the behavior of the population density of C. cebuensis at the landscape and sampling site level. The predictors which are highly significant at the landscape level include the following, a) relatively humidity (RH), b) tree basal area (TBA), and c) canopy cover (TCPY). Whereas, four predictors are found to be significant at the sampling site namely, a) elevation, b) slope, c) canopy cover, and d) shrub cover. However, at landscape level regression analysis shows that the final model (adjusted R2=0.345,F22,107=4.093, p<0.000) accounts for about 34.5% but only (adjusted R2=.212; F10,119=4.474, p<0.000), 21.2% for sampling site, hence, regression analysis done on the former is better than the later.',NULL,NULL,'Bocato, Fe M.','SOIL, RUNOFF, COVER PLANTS, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2310,'2021-09-01 07:44:46','2021-09-01 07:44:46','Morphological and physiological responses of IR64 rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutants associated with loss of resistance to brown spot (Bipolaris oryzae Shoem.) and blast (Magnaporthe oryzae Couch)','1982-09-01','The morphological and physiological responses of two IR64 mutants (D6766 and D10808) to brown spot and blast diseases were studied to contribute in understanding broad-spectrum resistance in rice.  The vegetative growth, chlorophyll content and level of endogenous abscissic acid (ABA) in uninoculated IR64 mutants were statistically similar to the IR64 wild type but inoculation with virulent brown spot and blast pathogens elicited different responses, making these mutants suitable materials for the study. Using standard disease severity indices, D10808 was assessed to have lost resistance to two diseases while D6766 lost resistance only to blast. Presence or absence of lignin, pectin, and phenolics that could prevent pathogen entry and colonization on the other hand had no clear correlation with loss of resistance. Segregation analysis of backcrosses and double mutants intercrossed suggest that the loss of resistance to brown spot and blast diseases was controlled by two independent recessive gene mutations. Inoculation with different isolates of brown spot and blast pathogens will verify this hypothesis. Loss of resistance in mutants was associated with significant reduction in growth parameters, reduction in chlorophyll content and lower ABA compared with IR64 wild type. The failure of IR64 mutants to induce production of ABA 3-7 days after inoculation could have contributed to the loss of resistance of D10808 both blast and brown spot and of D6766 to brown spot. Inability to activate ABA production after pathogen inoculation could be regulated by a single gene that was lost in susceptible mutants. The morphological and physiological responses differentiating susceptible IR64 mutants and resistant IR64 wild type to blast and brown spot diseases will be useful in future breeding for wide spectrum and durable resistance for rice diseases.',NULL,NULL,'Almendras, Angela S.','CASSAVA, PLANT SOIL RELATIONS, NUTRIENT UPTAKE, FERTILIZER APPLICATION, LIMING, INOCULATION, MYCORRHIZAE, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2311,'2021-09-01 07:44:46','2021-09-01 07:44:46','Applicability of nutrient manager for hybrid maize decision tool to white corn production','2021-09-01','Nutrient Expert for Hybrid Maize is a computer-based decision support tool enabling local experts to quickly formulate fertilizer guidelines for hybrid corn in a particular locality.  This model can serve as guideline to farmers to increase their yield and profit by suggesting a meaningful yield goal for their location and by providing a fertilizer management strategy required to attain the yield goal. The study was done to validate the applicability of Nutrient Manager for Hybrid Maize Decision Tool to white corn production; determine its effectiveness by assessing the predicted yield and actual yield for white corn; compare the grain yield and the economic benefit of the NM recommendation with the farmerâ€™s practice; and identify limitation(s) on the applicability of the software to white corn.  Different scenarios were created using different parameters and yield goal for white corn using secondary data from on-station trial to determine initially its applicability prior to the on-farm trial.  After this, on-farm trial was done in one corn growing area but involving five corn growers.  There were two treatments in this study, the Farmerâ€™s Practice and the NM Recommendation. The treatment plots were laid out in the farmerâ€™s field with 300 m2 each plot. Statistical analysis using t-test showed that the target and actual yield have no significant difference, indicating the applicability of the decision tool. Results likewise for white corn production indicate the applicability of the NM in developing location specific fertilizer management as shown by the non-significant t-test between the target yield and actual yield obtained.  Partial profit analysis showed that the change in benefit in all sites following the NM Recommendation is higher than in Farmerâ€™s Practice. Results of the study confirmed that Nutrient Manager for Hybrid Maize is also useful and applicable as decision support tool for the production of white corn through formulating fertilizer guidelines to attain yield goal based on the attainable yield. However, there is a need for further validation of its default values (sources and splitting fertilizer) to be more accurate in formulating fertilizer recommendation or meet the final fertilizer rate for every specific site to be more effective and can be useful to farmers.

Reports on allelic variations associated with RTSV resistance among rice cultivars showed that it is controlled by a single recessive gene (tsv1) mapped in chromosome 7 in Utri Merah where gene for putative translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4Gtsv1) is located. S-type allele of the gene was found in all susceptible plants (Nipponbare and TN1) and the non-S-type was found in resistant varieties (UM, TW16 and Utri Rajapan) which do not encode Val residue at amino acid position 1060 or 1061 of the gene. In this study, full-length clones of eIF4G gene from Nipponbare were characterized for the presence of the S-type allele examining both of its DNA and amino acid sequences. This will verify if the cloned Nipponbare eIF4G gene has the same sequence with that of the database since sequences in the database are commonly obtained by BAC libraries and shot-gun sequencing. The gene was cloned by PCR and the sequencing results were then used to align with the Nipponbareâ€™s genomic, coding and amino acid sequences for a part LOC_Os7g36940 from the Rice Genome Annotation Project Database and Utri Merah (GenBank: GQ203289). It was observed that these 5 eIF4G clones have the same coding sequence alignment with that of the Nipponbare in the region that encodes for Val residue at amino acid position 1060 or 1061, which is a characteristic of S-type allele found in RTSV susceptible rice varieties as describe by previous reports. Nucleotide sequence variants, SNP3177 and SNP3180, were observed in comparison with Utri Merah. These suggest that the eIF4G from Nipponbare being cloned by PCR has an S-type allele and reacts with RTSV infection as confirmed with positive ELISA results. A transformation cassette that will over-express the cloned eIF4G gene from the RTSV susceptible Nipponbare was then made by modifying the IRS463 over-expression vector (pCAMBIA 1300int-35Sp-hpRNAi) and inserting the gene of interest.

The fermented product is popularly known as angkak. This study aimed to establish an extraction procedure, investigate the functional and antimicrobial properties, and determine the potential of Monascus pigment as food colorant on native sausage locally known as longganisa. Samples of angkak were collected and evaluated based on their physico-chemical properties and microbial loads. Eight pigment-producing mold species were isolated and screened for maximum pigment production. Isolates C-1 and C-2 produced pigment with the highest optical densities (AU/g dry weight of sample) with values of 75.22 and 74.88, respectively. NSIC Rc158 was the most suitable rice variety for angkak production. Ethanol (70% concentration) was the most practical choice for pigment extraction since it is cheaper, volatile, and non-toxic. Crude Monascus pigment inhibited the growth of selected species of Gram (+) bacteria (B. subtilis and S. aureus) and fungi (F. oxysporum and M. ruoxii). Deoxy-D-ribose assay revealed that crude Monascus pigment has a site specific scavenging activity (77.57%) and was considered as good metal chelator. Also, it contains substantial amount of phenolic compound (9888.46 ÂµG GAE/g sample). Incorporation of crude Monascus pigment in native sausage (longganisa) has remarkably decreased the total plate and yeast counts as compared to untreated sample. The inhibition was relative to the concentration of extract on the product. Sausage prepared with 3% crude Monascus pigment was rated as the reddest sample during sensory evaluation, while untreated sausage as the palest. In terms of aroma and tenderness, differences between samples were generally unrecognizable. The strongest longganisa flavor was perceived in nitrite-treated samples, followed by sausages with either 1 or 2% crude Monascus pigment. Sausage with 3% crude Monascus pigment was perceived to have bitter off-flavor. Among the samples prepared with crude Monacus pigment, sausage with 1% extract was the most accepted and was significantly comparable to the nitrite-treated sausages even after 7 days of storage. Higher concentration of Monacus pigment has significantly produced a prominent bitter flavor in sausage which greatly influenced the consumer preference.  Result revealed that addition of 1% crude Monascus pigment on native sausage during formulation could be an alternative and natural way to minimize or totally avert the use of nitrite in meat products.',NULL,NULL,'Cabanban, Annadel S.','BONY FISHES, BIOLOGY, Fisheries',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2317,'2021-09-01 07:44:46','2021-09-01 07:44:46','Molecular analysis of the bacterial community associated with rice varieties with varying response to salinity','2021-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'De Guzman, Joedel A.','eggplant, borers$xentomology, Leucinodes orbonalis, bioassay',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2318,'2021-09-01 07:44:46','2021-09-01 07:44:46','Standardization of lime concentration for muscovado sugar processing using different sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) varieties\r\n','2021-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Lagos, Devralin T.','Environmental science, landslide$zSouthern Leyte, Philippines, disasters',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2319,'2021-09-01 07:44:46','2021-09-01 07:44:46','Effect of different dietary protein and energy levels on the growth, protein efficiency ratio and nutrient deposition of juvenile, Trochus niloticus\r\n','2021-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Daquila, Robelyn D.','Engineering, mango, dryer',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2320,'2021-09-01 07:44:46','2021-09-01 07:44:46','Bioprotection of Micropropagated Cavendish Banana by Vesicular Arbuscular Mycorrhiza (VAM) Fungi against the Burrowing Nematode Radopholus similis (Cobb) and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (E.

Results of the pot experiment showed that cotton cv UPL-C1 grown in Cauayan silt loam performed better than when it was raised in Quingua silty clay loam regardless of fertilizer applied mainly because of the differences in the soil\'s physical and chemical properties. Both soil types were deficient in N but well supplied in exchangeable K and B. The availability of P in the latter soil, however, was found insufficient for the crop. Regarding fertilization, the potted plants responded significantly to N, P and K fertilization, with the combination of 75-25-25 kg N-P2O5-K2O/ha as the best. Boron, on the other hand, caused growth and yield reduction (5.33%) from the crop. Its combination with N, P or both alleviated its negative effects, but this was intensified when it was applied along with K. In the presence of the three primary fertilizer elements, no depressive effect of B was observed. In the field trials, no general fertilizer rate was evolved for the two locations. Cotton cv Reba P279 grown in Solana, Cagayan needed 50-75 kg N and 50 kg P2O5/ha to attain a yield range of 1593-1793 kg seed cotton/ha. No response was obtained from K applied alone or in combination with N and P. In Echague, Isabela with the same variety as high as 75 kg N/ha alone was required to produce 2345 kg seed cotton/ha. The application of both P and K was already superfluous to the crop because of their highly adequate levels in the soil of this area. While fertilization had a significant influence on the crop regardless of the location especially that of N, which was shown as the most limiting element in both areas, it did not result in the crop\'s overvegetativeness, which could have imposed some difficulties in other field operations like that on pest management. However, more management efforts and inputs would normally be required in fertilized plants because of the production of more fruiting forms that need protection from insect attracts for a higher yield. On the other hand, boron fertilization in both locations did not give any considerable effect, nor any meaningful interaction with the primary elements detected. Thus, this indicated that its application in their location or in other areas of similar soil properties was unnecessary.',NULL,NULL,'Aquino, Albert P.','FARMS, FARM STRUCTURE, ZEA MAYS, PRODUCTIVITY, PHILIPPINES, Statistics',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2363,'2021-09-01 07:44:46','2021-09-01 07:44:46','The tobacco industry: comparative advantage and the impact of economic policies.','1981-09-01','Flue-cured and native tobaccos were evaluated for their comparative advantage in using domestic resources in relation to earning a net marginal unit of foreign exchange by applying the domestic resource cost (DRC) technique. Protection rates were also estimated to quantify the impact of general and specific price policies on economic incentives in tobacco production. The Philippines had a relative comparative advantage in producing flue-cured and native tobaccos with average DRC figures of 7.33 and 8.55 for flue-cured and native, respectively. These values were lower than the shadow price of foreign exchange of P9.89 per US dollar. These suggested that domestic resource cost was less than export price per unit. Economic profitability was higher than private profitability in both flue-cured and native tobaccos. The implicit tariffs caused the high cost of capital and tradeable inputs such as fertilizers and chemicals, gasoline and oil, which in turn made private costs higher than social costs. For flue-cured tobacco,  T-zone 4 (Abra) had the highest social profit which, resulted mainly from higher yield and lower tradeable input costs. For native tobacco, medium-yield farms were most profitable because of higher marginal returns to factors of production. Higher marginal returns to factors of production accounted for the degree of comparative advantage. For native tobacco, low-yield farms were not competitive. Areas with the highest cost of production had low comparative advantage. Changes in yield per unit area and world market prices had a more important influence on the DRC than prices of inputs like fertilizers and insecticides. The tobacco industry of the country managed to survive despite some policy-imposed penalties on inputs and outputs. Negative effective rates of protection (EPRs) were obtained suggesting that the primary factors in tobacco production earned lower with the presence of price-distorting policies than what these factors could have earned without these policies. Implicit tariffs on intermediate inputs such as fertilizers, insecticides, gasoline and oil were higher than nominal protection rate on output so that the net protection resulted in disincentive.',NULL,NULL,'Brion, Lilian A.','RESEARCH SUPPORT, AGRICULTURE, NATURAL RESOURCES, PHILIPPINES',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2364,'2021-09-01 07:44:46','2021-09-01 07:44:46','Evaluation of the effects of irrigation practices on the yield of sugarcane intercropped with legumes.','2021-09-01','This study intended to find out how controlled unscheduled water application affect a range of evaporative demands on the yields of sugarcance intercropped  with legumes. The experiment was conducted at Philippine Sugar Commission (PHILSUCOM), La Granja Agricultural Research Center using its gravity irrigation system and at the two irrigated private plantations in La Carlota Mill District from March 1978 to August 1979. Sugarcane rendement (piculs  sugar per ton cane or PS/TC) was not affected significantly by irrigation, nitrogen level and legume intercrop treatments although PS/TC in irrigated plots were slightly higher. Yield of sugarcane in tons cane per hectare (TC/Ha) was significantly affected by irrigation, nitrogen level and legume intercrop treatments. However, no interaction was observed between and among the mentioned treatments.  Irrigation treatment under water regime W-2 (1/2 pan evaporation less rainfall) gave the highest TC/Ha followed by water regime W-3 (pan evaporation less rainfall) and the lowest was water regime W-1 (rainfall). All treatments gave significant effects in terms of sugar yield in piculs sugar per hectare (PS/Ha). Irrigation treatment W-2 gave the highest PS/Ha  followed by W-3. Water regime W-1 gave the lowest PS/Ha. Nitrogen level N-2 (200 kg/ha) plots outyielded nitrogen level N-1 (100 kg/ha) plots. Soybean intercropped plots had the highest PS/Ha but did not differ significantly from mungbean-intercropped plots. From the nonlinear regression equation based on the response of yield (TC/Ha) to irrigation treatment under three water regimes, 60% of pan evaporation was the optimum water requierement of sugarcane to produce maximum yield. The unscheduled water applications showed no significant effect on two yield components of sugarcane (PS/TC and TC/Ha). The results suggested that adoption of intercropping practices on irrigated plantation will enhance land use and increase land productivity.',NULL,NULL,'Doncillo, Leonora D.','Fisheries, Sous vide technology$xSeafood product$vThesis$yAnaerobis, Sous vide technology$xSeafood product$vThesis$yMicrobiology, Sous vide technology$xSeafood product$vThesis$yPhysico-chemical, Sous vide technology$xSeafood product$vThesis$ySensorial quality',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2365,'2021-09-01 07:44:46','2021-09-01 07:44:46','Regional planning in the Philippines and IAD strategy formulation in Central Visayas, Philippines.','2021-09-01','The Philippine experience in national planning and regional planning was reviewed from the time of the Commonwealth up to the 1970s. The pre-1972 national plans were relevant in the development process but short on legislative and administrative support.  The national government adopted the post-1972 plans. Regional planning began in 1961 with the creation of regional development authorities.  Five of the  11 authorities created were fully organized.  Upon the enactment of the Integrated Reorganization Plan in 1972, Regional Development Councils (RDCs) assumed the overall responsibility of coordination and development planning in the regions. The RDC possesed many legal mandates for coordinating and planning the development of the regions.  Strengthening the RDCs needed no additional laws but a stricter implementation of all Letters of Instruction and Implementation, Presidential Decrees, and Executive Orders that pertain to the RDCs. The Five-Year Regional Development Plans established regional goals, objectives and strategies.  Based on the regional and provincial strategies, strategies for subregional, subprovincial Integrated Areas for  Development (IADs) in Central Visayas were formulated in the industry, agriculture, social  services and infrastructure sectors.  In Central Visayas, the overall regional strategy for development was industrialization.  In the IAD strategy formulation, the spatial hierarchy of industrialization were: Metro Cebu, Dumaguete City, Tagbilaran City, Bogo (Cebu), Toledo City, Danao City, Canlaon City and Bantayan (Cebu). In the primary sector, the IAD production areas for rice, corn, sugarcane, coconut, poultry, swine, goat, cattle, carabao and horse were identified.  Production of rice was identified for Bohol, Negros Oriental and part of Cebu while  sugarcane was for Negros Oriental and two IADs in Cebu.  Coconut and corn were priority crops in 9 and 12 IADs, respectively. The delivery of social services placed emphasis to IADs with depressed and lagging areas such as IADs with centers in Ubay (Bohol), Bayawan (Negros Oriental), Bais City and Danao City.  Three IADs registered satisfactory level of social services vis-?-vis the other IADs in the region. In the infrastructure sector, paving of existing road network was priority in 10 IADs; construction of barangay roads, 13 IADs; construction of municipal road, 7 IADs and construction of provincial road, 9 IADs. The IAD strategy formulation was an important step toward better program and projects identification, program packaging and prioritization at the Central Visayas.  Further studies were also identified to enrich and validate the formulated IAD strategies.',NULL,NULL,'Guzman Jr., Lito S.','Marine science, Fish$xNile tilapia$vThesis$yGrowth, Fish$xOreochromis niloticus$vThesis$yGrowth, Fish$xNile tilapia$vThesis$yStress, Fish$xOreochromis niloticus$vThesis$yStress',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2366,'2021-09-01 07:44:46','2021-09-01 07:44:46','Population development of the acarine fauna of soybeans grown in a modified grassland.','2021-09-01','The population density, occurrence, succession, and species diversity of acarines associated with soybeans grown in a modified grassland ecosystem on Mt. Makiling during one cropping season, from June to November 1979, were observed and analyzed.  A total of 30 species were recovered; these were classified into  three trophic groups, namely, phytophages, predators, and saprophages. Most species initially occurred during the vegetative stage.  Saprophages were the most abundant among all mites extracted from samples.  During the vegetative stage, young leaves harbored the highest populations of phytophagous species while the predators and saprophages were most abundant on the old leaves.  However, when reproductive structures appeared, the phytophages became more abundant on flowers and pods than on the foliage. Schizotetranychus lechrius Rimando was the only  species of spider mite recovered. Tetranychus kanzawai Kishida, which is often reported as a serious pest of soybeans in the lowlands, was not found. S. Lechrius generally occurred at a very low densities of 0.045 per leaflet.  Its most important predator was a phytoseiid mite, Ambryseius longispinousus (Evans).  Other important species were the phytophagous species, Brevipalpus obovatus Donnadidieu (Tenuipalpidae); the  predators, Amblyseius largoensis (Muma), Typhlodromus fleschneri Chant (Phytoseiidae), Asca sp. (Ascidae) and Iphidozercon sp. (Ascidae); and the saprophages Tyrophagus sp. (Acaridae); and the saprophages (Tyrophagus sp. (Acaridae) and Schgeloribates praeincisus (Berlese) (Oribatulidae).

The data were gathered through personal interviews, questionnaires, observations of work and field situations, and from the records of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) - the main government agency mandated by law to implement State policies and programs in fisheries. A total of 268 individuals served as respondents of  the study. Sixty-eight of the respondents were BFAR personnel who were directly or indirectly involved in communication, training and extension work. The other 200 were clients of the agency representing the municipal, commercial fishing and inland sectors of the fishery industry. The study showed that the country\'s fisheries development program was not being matched and supported with an appropriate communication mechanism to help realize its goals and objectives. The communication support structure that evolved out of existing State policies on fisheries development in the national fishery agency was wanting of integration, focus and unity of purpose and direction. The evident duplication of communication functions and activities of disparate and uncoordinated communication production units in the organization dissipated the use of scarce resources and rendered the entire communication effort inefficient and ineffective. Other than the fundamental weakness of its structure, the existing system was heavily saddled with a host of problems and constraints that had negatively affected its over-all performance. These included, among others, the predominance of unskilled and inexperienced, otherwise misplaced, communication production workers and the insufficient policy and budgetary support to production operations.  These resulted in either absence or shortage of communication facilities, equipment, supplies and materials and other operational resource. The performance of the extension delivery system of the national fishery agency suffered most, on the other hand, from the lopsided ratio (estimated at 1 : 1162) between the fishery extension workers and the clients of the industry. Among others, this mismatch in number remained the primary constraint in the communication effort along technology transfer and in the delivery of other extension services.

Increment core samples taken at breast height (about 1.5 m from the ground) were used in determining the specific gravity, extractive content and fiber dimensions of these trees. For all wood properties examined, very highly significant variation from the pith to the bark was observed. Specific gravity, fiber length and lumen width exhibited highly significant variation circumferentially (i.e., between radii within trees). The implication of these within-tree variations in sampling for wood quality evaluation using the increment core technique was discussed. Variation among trees was highly significant for all wood properties. This indicated selection of individual trees as a possible approach towards tree improvement. Contrary to expectation, however, fiber length did not show significant variation among trees. This suggested that selection for long fibers may be complicated by the relatively larger within-tree variations. Although the selected trees gave statistically better wood properties than the nonseed tree population, clear length and diameter breast height, which were the primary basis for selection, they failed to correlate significantly with any of the wood properties studied. Specific gravity was significantly correlated in a negative manner with fiber diameter and lumen width. Similarly, cell wall thickness was inversely correlated with lumen width. Selecting for increased specific gravity may, therefore, produce fibers with thicker walls and smaller lumens. The implications of this on pulp yield and quality were discussed. Using the discriminant function analysis, the seed trees were ranked according to their potentiality for higher yield. The results of this ranking indicated the necessity for wood quality evaluation of seed trees after selection by existing grading systems.',NULL,NULL,'Duya, Cheryl G.','Environmental science, Watershed$xMount Makiling$vThesis$yWater quality$zLos Banos, Laguna, Philippines, Watershed$xMount Makiling$vThesis$yWater quality$zBay, Laguna, Philippines, Watershed$xMount Makiling$vThesis$yMacroinvertebrates$zLos Banos, Laguna, Philippines, Watershed$xMount Makiling$vThesis$yMacroinvertebrates$zBay, Laguna, Philippines, Watershed$xMount Makiling$vThesis$yFish communities$zLos Banos, Laguna, Philippines, Watershed$xMount Makiling$vThesis$yFish communities$zBay, Laguna, ',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2373,'2021-09-01 07:44:46','2021-09-01 07:44:46','Processing of lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus DC.

Optimum mungbean yield was obtained when fertilized with 30 kg P2O5/ha. Beyond this level, a reduction in yield occurred. The addition of nitrogen fertilizer decreased mungbean yield. Phosphorus fertilizer did not  increase dry weed weight. However, an increase in dry weed weight was observed with the increased rate of nitrogen fertilization. In general, hand weeding resulted in high grain yield because of effective control of weeds but low return over variable cost, benefit-cost ratio and return per unit cash were obtained because of high requirements for labor. Preemergence application of butralin and butachlor required supplementary hand weeding for better yield. Dry weed weight was generally higher at the wider row spacing than at the closer spacing because of more space for weed growth. The optimum row spacing for mungbean was 50 cm. Controlling weeds in mungbean for a period of not less than four weeks from planting resulted in optimum yield. Weeds that emerged beyond four weeks after seeding were shaded out by the mungbean canopy and did not considerably reduced grain yield.

There is a need to estimate soil loss from these areas and soil transfer downstream to be able to fully capture the value of control measures and their on-site and off-site impact. The study determined the dominant factors affecting runoff and erosion processes in the scale of the watershed at 86-ha Tanhaga watershed in Alanib, Lantapan, Bukidnon. It is an elongated watershed in the north-south orientation with a slope of 16%. The major crops were corn and coffee.  The factors considered were rainfall characteristics, crop and soil cover conditions, and farming activities within the watershed. A stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to find predictive models for peak rates of runoff and soil loss considering individual rainfall events as units of analysis. At the watershed level, the peak runoff rate, Qp, was found dependent on the amount of runoff-producing rainfall, especially at higher flows. The relationship between peak runoff and rainfall amount was weak at peak rates of runoff below 100 L/second. The peak sediment load, SEDp, was highly influenced by the intensity of the runoff producing rainfall and to some extent by peak runoff. This result proved the hypothesis that a unique relationship existed between peak runoff and peak sediment load with rainfall intensity acting as the dominant parameter. At low flow conditions, two sets of predictors were derived for peak sediment load, SEDp, using the stepwise multiple regression analysis with intensity contributing 84% to the coefficient of determination in both sets. The first set included the minor contribution of duration of rainfall, and the tilled area within the last ten days prior to the occurrence of the runoff-producing rainfall, TA10. The negative coefficient of TA10 was interpreted to mean less sediment load with more disturbed areas due to reduced overland sheet flow as a result of increased surface roughness and higher infiltration rate brought about by tillage. The second and preferred form of the predictive equation included the square of  the intensity terms and rainfall amount. The peak rate of watershed soil loss, WSLp, and the total soil loss, E, for each rainfall event could be estimated by peak runoff rate, Qp, and hence by the amount of rainfall. At low flow conditions, Qp and SEDp combined to explain  the predicted value of their product, WSL. Field observations showed that the least rainfall amount that produced runoff in the watershed was 1.8 mm with an intensity of  0.36 per minute and duration of five minutes. Intensities of 0.05 mm to 0.01 mm per minute required at least 46 minutes to produce runoff. The  peak rate of runoff and soil loss at the Tanhaga watershed can, thus, be estimated and predicted using regression models. The rainfall amount could predict peak runoff while peak runoff could be used to estimate the total soil loss per rainfall event. In addition to rainfall amount, rainfall intensity is needed to predict peak sediment load.

Data on field fertilizer trials at the different rice and corn growing areas of Cebu and the  updated soil analyses of the different soil types were studied.

Results of the study showed that nitrogen was the major nutrient that limits the yield of rice and corn in the soil type studied. The pattern of nitrogen response varied greatly with location but slightly with soil types.  Areas devoted to rice and corn have organic matter content lower than three percent, a limit between nitrogen deficiency and sufficiency.

Shrimps in the latter experiment were fed the second batch diets containing casein, soybean meal, squidmeal, fish meal and shrimp meal as protein sources at ten percent of the individual body weight for the first two weeks and eight percent for the remaining four weeks. Sand-gravel filtered seawater with salinity range of 32-34 ppt and temperature of 27-32? C was allowed to flow continuously at a rate of 0.8 - 1.0 L/minute. Results indicated the highest weight gain in diets containing 40-45% protein. Lower gains were observed in shrimps fed with lower or higher than 40-45% protein. Best feed conversion, protein efficiency ratio and survival were also obtained from these levels.

An interview schedule was used to gather the needed information from the 338 coconut farmers. The  respondents\' average age was 52.48 with an average farming experience of 23.9 years. Their mean educational attainment was 5.7 years; average number of household member, 6.16 and of living children, 5.42. Their average annual income was P5,969.47. The majority were owner-operators and slightly over one-half of them were part-time farmers. They had an average farm size of 3.29 ha. The respondents were innovative on an average of 4.9 recommended practices and exhibited high-adoption rate in selecting the seedlings for transplanting, preparing the seednuts for germination, selecting the planting materials, replanting, laying out the field before planting and intercropping. The practices with low adoption were plowing, controlling pests, controlling diseases, and application of fertilizer. Their reasons for not performing a certain practice included ignorance of the advantage of the practice, uncertainty of its success, want of money to buy the inputs and lack of knowledge. Sources of farm information, aspirations in life, perception of coconut farming, attitude towards modernization in coconut farming, annual gross income, size of farm, production credit and expectations from coconut farming were found significantly related to innovative performance. Farmers were beset with many problems such as low price of copra, low yields, no working animals, poor sharing system, frequent occurrence of typhoons and presence of rats. It was also revealed that preparing the seednuts for germination and plowing was considered \"very simple\"; intercropping, replanting aand selecting the seedlings for transplanting, \"simple\"; selecting the planting materials, laying out the field before planting and fertilizing, \"difficult\"; and controlling pests diseases, \"very difficult\" to understand and use.',NULL,NULL,'Feraren, Julius P.','AGROINDUSTRIAL SECTOR, INVESTMENT, LAGUNA, Industry',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2384,'2021-09-01 07:44:46','2021-09-01 07:44:46','Selection of sorghum genotypes for tolerance to water stress.','1991-09-01','This study was conducted to identify sorghum genotypes tolerant to water stress and compare their response to drought-stress, waterlog and optimum water conditions. The grain yield in sorghum was highest at the optimum treatment with significant yield reduction in both the drought-stress and waterlog treatment. All genotypes were stable yielders across environments having linear regression coefficient of 0.99-1.0. Plant stand density was not affected by the water stress treatments. Some genotypes had few differences in their stand count but these were  attributed to inherent difference in seed viability. The length of panicle was highest at the optimum treatment but greatest reduction was observed in the waterlog treatment. The tall sorghum genotypes had greater panicle length reduction than those of the short statured varieties in the treatments. Plant height was affected by the water stress treatments at the vegetative stage. On the other hand, plant height at maturity showed similar trends although the differences observed were at greater degrees. The days-to-flowering in sorghum under the drought stress condition was significantly earlier compared to those under optimum condition. Flowering in those of the waterlogged treatments were significantly delayed. Moreover, days-to-physiological maturity were earlier in the water stress treatments.

Irrigation in the early dry season from mid-November to early February, after 25-75% of the available soil moisture had been depleted, did not influence total yield, tuber sizes and composition. In the late dry season from March to May, higher total yield and large-sized tubers were obtained with irrigation at 25% available soil moisture depletion. High yields of frequently irrigated plants could be due to the high net assimilation rate, water-use efficiency, and relative water content observed. In both cropping seasons, however, the weight of marketable tubers produced by plants irrigated at 25 and 50% available soil moisture were comparable. Moisture stress (75% depletion of the available soil moisture prior to irrigation) resulted in the high incidence of growth cracks and knobby second growth in both seasons. Hollow heart observed only in the early dry season was not affected by the soil moisture treatments. Potato plants grown in soil containing 0.14% N, 10.40 ppm NO3-N and 0.23 me K and fertilized with 60-240 kg N-K/ha produced comparatively high total and marketable yield as a consequence of high leaf area index and relative water content.

This evaluated the influence of phosphorous (P) fertilizer on the availability of Zn to the rice plant when grown in soils with varying properties. The soils were fertilized with 0, 30 and 60 ppm P as P2O5, and 0, 2 and 4 ppm Zn along with 50 ppm each of N and K. There were significant differences in height and dry matter yields among soil types. Interactions of the soil and P resulted in a significant reduction in Zn content and uptake by plant tops, and increased significantly the Zn accumulation in roots. Phosphate fertilization significantly reduced the translocation of Zn from roots to tops, expressed as a ratio (top: root ratio). The effect of phosphate fertilization on Zn adsorption capacity was studied using dilute ZnSO4 solutions in five Zn-deficient paddy soils initially treated with 0, 30 and 60 ppm  P as P2O5 at temperatures 25, 30 and 35? C. The adsorption isotherms conformed to the Langmuir equation when the curves were resolved into two linear portions. Adsorption maximum, b, for Part 1 (0-2 ppm Ci) was lower than Part 2 (2-10 ppm Ci), while bonding energy values, k, were much higher in Part 1 than in Part 2. Higher P fertilization of the soils reduced Zn adsorption in Quinqua sl, Calumpang sl, Mandaue cl and Guadalupe c. Zinc adsorption increased with P fertilization in San Manuel scl. The increased adsorption was characterized by low bonding energy. Adsorption maximum for Zn increased with CEC and Ca2+  content but decreased with increasing soil Zn content. As temperature was increased from 25? C to 30? C and then finally to 35? C, Zn adsorption decreased in Quinqua sl, Calumpang sl and San Manuel scl, while it increased in Guadalupe c. Mandaue cl had no adsorption maximum. Further tests showed that Zn ratio was influenced by soil properties and was negatively correlated with adsorption maxima and bonding energies at zero P fertilization. The result suggested that phosphate-induced Zn deficiency in rice plant is a physiological inhibition of Zn by P occurring on the root surface and/or in root cells, especially in soils high in Ca2+ content and high inherent P supply.',NULL,NULL,'Catedral, Isagani G.','COTTON, SEED, CROP YIELD, FERTILIZER APPLICATION, INSECT CONTROL, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2390,'2021-09-01 07:44:46','2021-09-01 07:44:46','Leyte farmers\' perceptions of and expectations from the National Coconut Planting/Replanting Program (NCP/RP).','2021-09-01','The study attempted to provide a baseline information on the Leyte farmers\' perceptions of and expectations from the NCP/RP.

It had a complete metamorphosis with six distinct life stages: egg, I larva, II larva, prepupa, pupa and adult.  The insect was responsible in the formation of epiphyllous and/or hypophyllous leaf roll galls mostly concentrated on the apical shoots of the plant. The field experiment showed the preference of the thrips in plants subjected to partial shading, spaced 15 cm x 15 cm and  applied with 3 g N per seedling (treatment interaction effect) or partial shading, spaced 100 cm x 100 cm and no fertilization (treatment simple effect). The level of  injury caused by the insects was low. Fertilization reduced pest incidence and level of injury. More infested seedlings died before application of fertilizer. Consequently, more seedlings recovered from infestation with the application of 3 g N per seedling. There was a relatively lower proportion of the seedlings that died because of infestation compared with those that died due to other causes. Partial shading favored significantly survival of newly hardened seedlings, however, full exposure greatly influenced the overall survival of seedlings at the later stages of seedling development. Application of 7 g N per seedling induced mortality. No application or application of 3 g N per seedling had better effect. Treatment combination of full exposure, 100 cm x 100 cm spacing and no fertilizer application highly favored survival. Shading and fertilization significantly affected diameter and height growth of the seedlings.

Primary production was measured from November 1979 to October 1980 by the light-and-dark bottle O2 method. Bioassays of the lake water with hypolimnial water and with nutrient concentrate were made from July to September 1980 to determine if nutrients limited the production. One cubic meter experimental cages made of CO-polyethylene nets were installed in triplicates at the SW portion of the lake and stocked with T. nilotica fingerlings at 50 cu m for growth study. Stockings were made six times from March  to September 1980. Thermal stratification was observed from September to November 1979 and March to September 1980. The period December 1979 to February 1980 was a season of instability with periods of upwelling anoxic hypolimnial water that could make the lake unfit for fish culture. Bioassays indicated that nutrients were limiting in August 1980. Although primary production during the period of upwelling was one of the highest, the best period for cage culture was from March to July. Fingerlings stocked during this period grew from 5 g to 100 g in three months. The following equations established certain relationships:      a.

Luisita, San Miguel, Tarlac. Cropped area estimates were determined from the Image-100 multispectral analysis of Landsat-2 MSS Data taken on three acquisition dates in 1976. Cane/sugar yield estimates were obtained from numerical models developed using the stepwise regression procedure wherein (1) 13-year record of yields were regressed against six weather variables, and (2) the 1976 cane/sugar yields against nine vegetation indices calculated from the brightness values extracted from the Landsat-2 imageries. The cane-cropped area was best estimated, delineated, and mapped in the August 26, 1976 imagery (relative difference), R.D. = 1.2%) because on this date the actively growing canes presented sharp contrast in brightness with the residentials, fallows, and the surrounding rice lands. Both the weather-based and Landsat yield models gave significant coefficients of determination (R2) but  the former proved superior in terms of stability, reproducibility and the ability to give estimates at least two months in advance of the start of milling. Of the six climatic variables tested, namely, monthly maximum and minimum temperature, rainfall, percent relative humidity, rainy days and sunshine duration, the monthly sunshine duration showed the highest potential in predicting cane yield (R2 = 99.20) and sugar yield (R2 = 96.24). When the combined effect of the six weather variables were regressed against yield, comparable results were obtained: R2 = 98.89 for cane yield and R2 = 96.45 for sugar yield. Further computer analysis of Landsat data showed that the study area could be accurately classified into age groups of three-month intervals. Visual comparisons of computer print-out maps with ground truth were presented and quantitatively supported by age-predicting equations using vegetation indices from Landsat data. Integrating the area and yield estimates, the sugarcane production computed from the two sets of data both passed the set acceptable limit of ten percent relative difference. The true production value was more closely approximated by the area and yield determined entirely from Landsat data. However, the combined approach using Landsat data for area and against agromet model for yield estimate is recommnded in view of its greater stability and reproducibility.

The study showed that significant differences were observed among varieties on horticultural characteristics, fruit characters and qualities. Yield was significantly affected by excessive rainfall during the wet season planting. Flowering and fruit setting were markedly reduced as evidenced by the less fruits borne per cluster. Also, more infected plants were noted among susceptible varieties because of high soil moisture favoring the virulence of the bacterial wilt disease. Fruit characters varied significantly among varieties. Four fruit shapes and colors were observed. Brighter colors were noted during the wet than in the dry season. Varieties with deep oblate,  plum and pear fruit shapes were very smooth, an ideal type for processing tomatoes while those with deep globes had relatively thinner skin and susceptible to radial and concentric cracking. The different qualities of the fruit varied significantly among varieties. Analytical results showed that eight out of the 26 varieties were superior in total solids and viscosity during the dry season and six during the wet season. The pH of the fruit varied from 4.26 to 4.43 with majority in the range of 4.30 and 4.40. The range in pH exhibited by the 26 varieties was still ideal for processing tomatoes. Interaction between seasons and varieties on pH was insignificant but highly significant on yield, total solids, and viscosity. Generally, varieties San Marzano, Manalucie, Red Cherry, Z-800, Roma, Roma F-P, Pearson and Tropi Red were identified as potential materials for processing while varieties  Improved Pope, BPI No. 2, Reigyuku and VC-49 for fresh market production.

The model was tested in the Makiling Forest Management Unit considering 48 land-use management strategies, 26 goals in two time periods and 51 management constraints. The major land-uses considered were agrisilviculture, range, timber and nontimber plant products, water, recreation, wilderness and wildlife sanctuary. Management strategies were restricted by resource capability, economic, technical  and environmental constraints. The model was run several times using different sets of demand levels for two time periods (1979 and 1987). Sensitivity analysis/parametric programming was done in the budget constraint and in the objective function of the model by varying the deviational weights. The decoded computer output showed the area allocation for each of the land-use management strategies, forest product/service mix, achievement levels of the goals for forest products and services, underachievement/overachievement from goal attainment levels, and the trade-offs among goals. Other insights necessary in decision making such as the economic, social, and environmental implications of the optimal multi-objective resource allocation under the integrated-use forest management scheme were obtainable from the model\'s solution.

The respondents cultivated on the average 3.36 ha of abaca, harvesting three to four times a year with a total of 1,245.05 abaca stalks/ha with each stalk weighing 17.42 kg. The fibers were hand-stripped. Some abaca wastes were used for the production of wild edible mushrooms, roofing and walling materials, baskets and home decors, and pulp and paper. The older the abaca wastes from which extracts were obtained or incorporated in the growing medium, the higher was the percentage of tomato seed germination. The plants grown in the three-month-old waste extract and those in the soil with two- to three-month-old wastes had germination percentage as good as those in the soil, or using over-a-year-old wastes. As the concentration of the waste extract decreased from 1:10 to 1:50, the percentage germination increased, with the germination in the latter concentration equivalent to that of the control. Seedling height was not affected by the concentration of the extract. Mulched seedlings in seedboxes were taller and had greater dry weight than those on soil in which wastes were incorporated. Tomato plants in pots fertilized with 60 kg N/ha had higher fruit set and yield than other treatments. Although there was a tendency for the yield to increase with an increase in mulching thickness from 0-6 in, the differences were not significant.

Tha data collected were analyzed using frequencies, percentages, and means to describe the characteristics of the subjects of the study. Relationships of variables were analyzed by a linear regression model. Homemakers aged 31-40 years old comprised the greatest bulk of the respondents. Two-thirds of the respondents had elementary level of education. Their occupations were generally of the \"blue-collar\" type. The average household size was six persons. Over 50% of the respondents belonged to the expanding family life-cycle stage; more than 50% also belonged to households with more female members; households were composed of dominantly young members, 20 years and below.

The treatments included no tilling and no  liming, Treatment I (control); liming alone, Treatment II; tilling alone, Treatment III; and tilling with liming, Treatment IV. There was a general increase (0.5 to 1.0 unit) in dry soil pH in all treatments. The increase in pH was associated with the decrease in the concentrations of potential acidity, aluminum and sulfate. The concentrations of active iron and manganese were low and stable throughout the study. All soil parameters measured were not significant among treatments at 5%  level of probability. The concentrations of alkalinity, sulfate and aluminum in water were regulated by pH. Iron exhibited higher concentrations in control than the treated ponds, while phosphorus showed slightly lower concentrations in tilled ponds than the others. In general, the values of pH, alkalinity, aluminum, sulfate and phosphorus in water were not significantly different at 5% level of probability. The overall mean of the weekly gross primary productivity measured by diel oxygen method showed identical values for all treatments, although the control treatment had slightly lower values. But the differences were not significant. The fish yield was highest in Treatment III (312.6 kg/ha). This was closely followed by Treatments IV, II (306.2 and 304.2 kg/ha, respectively), and I (265.7 kg/ha). Generally, tilling and liming alone or in combination was not of much value because they did not affect any of the soil or water properties, primary productivity, or the fish yield significantly. However, tilling of pond bottom had better effects than those of  liming. This indicated that the application of lime was not necessary to circumvent the problems of acid sulfate if the ponds had been earlier reclaimed by repeated tilling and flushing. This also indicated that for improving acid sulfate soils, removing the acidity and other toxic elements was better than neutralizing them by liming because in liming, regardless of the quantities applied, the toxic elements remain in the soil.',NULL,NULL,'Cui, Leopoldo C.','FARMERS, DECISION MAKING, RICE, SAMAR, Social sciences',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2421,'2021-09-01 07:44:47','2021-09-01 07:44:47','Review of fisheries management and development.','1977-09-01','(no abstract)',NULL,NULL,'Cunanan, Diosdado R.','SUGARCANE, CROP YIELD, NITROGEN, FERTILIZERS, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2422,'2021-09-01 07:44:47','2021-09-01 07:44:47','The occurrence of post-larval and juvenile stages of some economically important fishes in three milkfish fry collecting grounds in Panay Island.','1983-09-01','(no abstract)',NULL,NULL,'Galamay, Teresita D.','COTTON, PLANTING DATE, FERTILIZER APPLICATION, NITROGEN',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2423,'2021-09-01 07:44:47','2021-09-01 07:44:47','Mechanism of joint action of insecticides on malathion-resistant diamond-back moth (Plutella xylostella L.).','1982-09-01','The joint action of malathion + mevinphos, malathion + EPN, malathion + trichlorfon and mevinphos + EPN at three dosages were evaluated on two Plutella malathion-resistant populations (College and Trinidad, 305-fold- and 735-fold-resistant, respectively). Marked potentiation was observed with malathion-mevinphos mixture in both populations but antagonistic to all other mixtures. CHE studies showed that the CHE activity in Trinidad was higher than in College population. The relative order of decreasing inhibition of the insecticides at LD10 and LD50 to both populations were: mevinphos > malathion > EPN. The application of either EPN or mevinphos together with malathion increased the inhibitory activity of malathion. Reactivation of the phosphorylated enzyme was relatively fast in the Trinidad as compared to College population. The application of EPN together with either malathion or mevinphos enhanced the reactivation of the phosphorylated enzyme which partially accounted for the low inhibition and therefore antagonistic action of the mixtures. Metabolic studies showed that degradation of malathion in Plutella was similar to those reported in insects, other animals and plants which consisted mainly of hydrolytic reaction catalyzed by either pjhosphatases or carboxyesterase enzymes. The major metabolic route in the college strain was hydrolysis by phosphatase which cleave the P-O-X linkage liberating the acidic group (DMDTPA). The hydrolysis by carboxylesterase which cleave the carboxyester group of malathion or malaoxon to form nontoxic product (malathion acid) was predominant in the Trinidad strain, a highly malathion-resistant population. Resistance of Plutella to malathion was due to decreased sensitivity of CHE to inhibition, a rapid reactivation of phosphorylated enzyme and increased carboxyesterase activity.

The soil pH of the ponds was near neutral (6.8 to 7.4) initially and later became slightly acidic (5.3 to 6.5). This could be attributed to the diffusion of acids from materials underneath the pond bottom. Soil pH was significantly and inversely correlated with Al+3 , Mn+2 and SO4= as well as redox potential. Water pH correlated similarly with these ions. The study involved five levels of nitrogen and four levels of phosphorus. Of all the treatment combinations, N:P ratios of 1:1, 4:1 and 2:1 were effective in terms of good plankton growth.  Treatment 4 (240:120) showed the highest growth among the treatments. Other treatments that showed comparable values were Treatment 18 (240:30), Treatment 10 (120:30), Treatment 19 (60:60) and Treatment 20 (120:120). Inorganic N and P applied did not show any significant influence on total soil N and available P as well as in the NH4+ -N and NO3-  -N content of the water. This could be due to the possible influence of the physico-chemical factors on the abovementioned elements especially on available P in soil and soluble P in water. Fluctuations in cell count and dry weight measurements were observed during the whole study period. However, all treatments showed a general increase in cell count and dry weight after ten weeks of culture. Cell counting using the haemacytometer, though time consuming, was a better method in assessing plankton growth compared to dry weight measurements because interference from suspended solids and high salt concentrations could be eliminated.',NULL,NULL,'Duremdez, Roselyn C.','PSEUDOMONAS, PSEUDOMONAS, OREOCHROMIS NILOTICUS, OREOCHROMIS NILOTICUS, PHYSIOLOGY, PHYSIOLOGY, IDENTIFICATION, IDENTIFICATION, Fisheries, Fisheries',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2018-04-19-04_ab_54755.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(2427,'2021-09-01 07:44:47','2021-09-01 07:44:47','Economic evaluation of selected reforestation strategies.','1987-09-01','This study was conducted primarily to come up with an acceptable strategy of reforestation using economic criteria in arriving at the decision.

In arriving at an acceptable strategy, four reforestation projects were first evaluated in terms of technical efficiency. These were the Forest Developent Project in Ilocos Norte and the RP-Japan Forest Development Project in Nueva Ecija representing government-administered reforestation, the Bamban Contract Reforestation Project, the Tree Resources and Environmental Enterprise, Inc. and the Gregorio Araneta University Foundation, Inc. representing corporate contract reforestation. A conclusion as to which project is operating most efficiently cannot be made because different site conditions resulted to varying application of technology. In the cash flow analyses, reforestation technology was treated as constant but strategies for implementation were varied. Costs and benefits were identified in each option. The information was used in the cash flow analyses. In the analyses, three points of view were analyzed representing different levels of decision making. These were the contractor\'s, government\'s, and society\'s points of view. Using the criteria above, the contractor and the government had different choices. However, from the society\'s viewpoint, the efficient choice was to contract only the maintenance and protection phase. The establishment phase must be done by the government.

Ratoons emerged approximately 13 days earlier than replants. Ratoons were not severely damaged by pests regardless of density and N levels of application. Slight damage caused by slug caterpillar and corn weevil was observed. Generally, ratoons had more rapid vegetative growth than replants regardless of plant density and N level, although the application of 100 kg N/ha favored height and girth increment after a period of 12 months. Unlimited ratoons exhibited better performance over ratoons at controlled density. At advanced stages, however, a reduction in girth showing characteristics of \"tanguiltils\" was observed in unlimited ratoons. In other gross morphological characteristics like petiole length, leaf blade length and width, ratoons at any density manifested superior performance over the replants. Furthermore, ratoons also had significantly higher fresh and dry matter weight of stalk and leaves than those of the replants. Leaf N content significantly increased with increased N application during the 6th month but not after 12 months. Plant density did not affect leaf N content.

Vegetative growth and fiber yield increased with N, P, K fertilization up to 50 kg N/ha, 40 kg P205/ha and 75 kg K20/ha, respectively, but decreased at higher fertilizer levels. Percent fiber recovery was not significantly affected by varying rates of N, P and K fertilizers. Tensile strength of the fiber, however, increased with K fertilization. Leaf N, P and K generally but slightly increased with N, P and K fertilization, respectively. These elements also increased with time from fertilization. Moreover, the amount of these nutrients in the soil likewise increased slightly with N, P and K application. The amount of Ca in the leaves and in the soil, including soil pH, were not significantly influenced by the addition of varying rates of N, P and K fertilizers. However, Ca in the leaves and in the soil increased initially after N, P, and K fertilization then decreased towards the end of the test period. Plant height did not significantly affect leaf N and P but affected leaf K. The shorter (100 cm) plants gave significantly higher leaf K than the taller (150 cm) ones. Leaf rank significantly influenced leaf N and P but not leaf K. Younger leaves had significantly higher N and P contents than the older ones. The second and third fully expanded leaves from the top gave statistically equal N values but greater than the fourth leaf, while the second leaf had significantly higher P content than both the third and fourth leaves. Samples taken from the third leaf of 100 cm plants two months after fertilization proved satisfactory for the study of the N status of abaca. For P, satisfactory result was obtained from both the second and third leaves of plants 100 cm and 150 cm high, respectively, four months after fertilization. The fourth leaf of 100 cm plants taken four months after fertilization proved satisfactory for the study of the K nutrition of abaca.

Using least-squares curve fitting technique, the analytical solution presented by Cagauan et al. in 1968 was fitted to the experimental data of ion concentration in the effluent as a function of pore volume (PV) to evaluate the dispersion coefficient (D) and effective pore volume (Ve). Effective pore volume is an expression of the volume of effluent at which the ion concentration in the effluent is 0.5 of the displacing solution. The values of D for Cl ranged from 0.18 to 3.65 sq cm/hour and for K from 0.36 to 5.65 sq cm/hour, which generally increased with the average pore water velocity. Also, D was higher in the soils than in the sand. The values of Ve for Cl was about equal to one PV in the sand but were significantly lower in the soil indicating exclusion of Cl in the latter medium. On the other hand, for K the values of Ve in the soils were eight times or greater than one PV indicating strong retention of K in the soil through cation exchange. In a leaching experiment using soil columns, the movement of K and Cl from KCl fertilizer applied at the soil surface were followed after leaching of 15 cm of water, applied once or thrice 5 cm pulse. Concentration of K and Cl at different soil depths was measured one day after water application. Results indicated that Cl moved deeper into the soil with peak concentration occurring at the 30 and 40 cm soil depth range. Chloride peak concentration in the pulse was deeper than in the single application of water, which meant that leaching of Cl was more efficient in the former than in the latter. On the other hand, K practically was immobile in the soil. Peak concentration of this ion was  confined only at the 0-5 cm soil  depth range after the application of 15 cm of water.Using the values of D and Ve obtained from the miscible experiment, the equation presented  by Rose et al.

The concept was induced in one of the successful agricultural program in the Philippines, the People\'s Livelihood Foundation, Inc. (PLFI) in Capas, Tarlac, headed by a former prominent New People\'s Army (NPA) Commander who was popularly known as \"Kumander Dante or Ka Dan\". The establishment of the PLFI was brought about by the worsening socioeconomic condition of the people in the area reflected by a lopsided tenurial/agrarian system. A survey revealed that the farmers fully depended on the land they tilled as their main source of livelihood. For the farmers, land ownership was not the answer to their socioeconomic problems. They needed inputs and support services in the form of timely and affordable credit, fertilizer and pesticides, production and market facilities and technical assistance. Livelihood program/projects were implemented through the following unique operational strategies to directly uplift the socioeconomic conditions of the people in the area: a) Capitalist in management referred to an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods; by investments that were determined by private decision rather than by state control; and by prices, production and the distribution of goods that were determined in a free market. Thus, capitalist management had been operationalized within the context of the people\'s aspirations and existing resources; b) Socialist in sharing stressed cooperation rather than the selfish nature of human being eliminating the conditions that promote self-centered thirst for property. Its thrust was the development of the productive forces, the operation of which required collective labor and power, so as to accomplish the eradication of both poverty and inequity; and c) Integrated cooperative in the context that everything the farmers did and owned had a complementary relationship or revolved around each other. Hence, it was an illustration of the interrelationship of each of the implemented projects in the whole farming cycle from the selection of seeds, production, processing to marketing. The farmer-beneficiaries did not only cooperated in areas where it would be beneficial to them. Within the abovementioned unique PLFI operational strategies, the management and leadership approaches, style and behavioral patterns towards the farmer-beneficiaries of the programs were analyzed. Though in particular, the anlysis context hinged more on the quality of leadership available. The analysis showed that it was better to have an effective leader than mere efficient since the former achieved things with their people while the latter accomplished things at the people\'s expense. However, PLFI experience reflected lack of succession and sustainability as its major leadership weakness. This was one of the needs for the continuity of any program particularly those intended for the rural poor. It required qualified successor. The question of succession was also an area of concern. Strengths, on the other hand, were gleaned on the resources poured to the Foundation from both local and international institutions composed of government, private sector, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs).

Ex Ait.), kakawate [Gliricidia sepium (Jacq,) Walp.] and Sesbania [Sesbania sesban (Linn.) Merr.] used as hedgerows for gabi and camote as ally crops under Samar condition were evaluated. This was carried out over a span of three years from October 1989 to September 1992 at the grassland portion of the University of Eastern Philippines, University Town, Northern Samar. The study determined the effects of these tree hedgerow species on the growth and yield of the alley crops, and on soil chemical and physical properties. It also determined the biomass yield and other growth characteristics (e.g. tolerance to pruning, drought resistance) of the hedgerows. The hedgerows did not significantly affect the growth and yield of gabi in the first cropping but did so in the second cropping. Height growth of gabi in the second cropping was highest (101.3 cm) in Flemingia-treated plots, followed in descending order, by kakawate-treated plots (79.33) cm), Sesbania-treated plots (68.67 cm) and control plots (53.00 cm). For the average leaf area per plant of gabi on the 8th month, Flemingia-treated plots again came out at the top (7,300.00 sq cm), followed by kakawate-treated plots (4,862.00 sq cm), Sesbania-treated plots (3,158 sq cm), and control plots (1,106.00 sq cm). For total above-ground biomass yield at maturity, Flemingia plots were highest (10.66 t/ha), followed by kakawate plots (7.64 t/ha), Sesbania plots (4.58 t/ha), and control plots (1.20 t/ha). In terms of total tuber yield, Flemingia-treated plots were highest (9.87 t/ha), followed by kakawate plots, Sesbania plots and control plots with 6.5, 4.05 and 1.02 t/ha, respectively. Similarly, the growth and yield and other production parameters of camote were also significantly affected by different hedgerows in the second cropping. In terms of the length of camote vines 30 days after planting, Flemingia had the highest degree of influence with the highest mean of 371.67 cm followed by kakawate (351 cm), sesbania (307 cm), and control (291 cm). For vine fresh weight at harvest, Flemingia also had the highest degree of influence at 19.89 t/ha, followed by kakawate (17.53 t), Sesbania (15.22 t), and control. In terms of tuber yield, Flemingia-treated plots produced the highest yield of 8.02 t/ha, followed by kakawate, Sesbania and control plots with 7.04, 5.98 and 3.88 t/ha of tuber yield, respectively. Changes in soil chemical properties under the different hedgerow treatments were minor. In terms of OM contribution, kakawate ranked first with approximately 32.65%, followed by Flemingia (14.29%), Sesbania (12.75%) and control (6.45%). The accumulation of OM under control plots may be attributed to the remains of the alley crops and weeds which were either incorporated or allowed to decompose inside each plot. In general, there was an insignificant addition of phosphorus under control (6.50 ppm) and Sesbania (7.33 ppm) plots; and highly significant additions under kakawate  (17.33 ppm) and Flemingia (16.67 ppm) plots, from the original or initial levels of 5.17, 5.0, 3.83 and 5.83 ppm for control, Sesbania, kakawate and Flemingia plots, respectively. For available potassium in the soil, kakawate contributed the greatest amount (375.83 ppm). However, the three hedgerows did not differ significantly in terms of adding potassium. Kakawate exhibited the highest overall yield of fresh weight herbage at 84.87 t/ha which did not differ significantly with Flemingia\'s 81.28 t/ha. Kakawate and Flemingia, however, each significantly differed with the overall fresh weight herbage yield of Sesbania\'s 47.66 t/ha. In terms of dry weight herbage yield, Flemingia\'s 28.58 t/ha significantly outyielded kakawate\'s 21.22 t/ha which in turn significantly differed with Sesbania\'s 14.30 t/ha. Both kakawate and Flemingia had higher proportions of leaf yield over their respective stem yield. Sesbania, on the other hand, had lower proportion of leaf yield than its stem yield. Kakawate and Flemingia were drought resistant and showed higher potentials for enhancing nutrient cycling compared with Sesbania.

These were investigated using cross-section data for crop year 1992-93 of 625 lowland rainfed rice-based farmers in Tigbauan, Iloilo and Manaoag, Pangasinan. The Cobb-Douglas stochastic production frontier was used to derive the efficiency estimates. The stochastic  production frontiers were estimated through corrected ordinary least squares method (COLS). A number of plausible determinants were regressed on efficiency estimates to examine the determinants of efficiency. Results indicated the following hypotheses as true: (1) the more intensive a cropping pattern is, the more it becomes profitable; (2) the more intensive a cropping pattern is, the more a farmer becomes technically and allocatively (price) efficient; (3) variables such as education and off-farm income have direct positive relationship with technical and allocative (price) efficiencies of farmers; and (4) farmer with tenure status other than share tenant is more technically and allocatively (price) efficient. The estimated production frontiers showed that majority of the farmers used the best practice technique available especially in the production of first rice crop, making their farm output approach the potential level. What accounted most for technical inefficiency of farmers were the factors outside their control. Results also revealed that more farmers were allocatively efficient in the use of labor and fertilizer in the production of first crop than in the production of second crop. However, farmers were more efficient in allocating their labor than fertilizer inputs. Comparison of optimal and actual use of labor and fertilizer showed that farmers either underutilize or overutilize both inputs. However, farmers underutilize more frequently these two inputs. The policy implication that could be derived from the findings of the study was that production efficiency of farmers in the lowland rainfed rice-based areas can still be further improved. It was apparent that ineffiiciencies were due to modifications (e.g. underutilization/overutilization of inputs) being made by farmers in the adoption of a particular technology. Such modifications could be lessened, if not totally avoided, if the government intensifies provisions of support services like credit and technical information campaign and implements programs that would enhance farmers\' education, improve tenurial arrangements and increase additional off-farm income.',NULL,NULL,'Dela Cruz, Editha M.','GROUNDNUTS, PEANUTS, PEANUT STRIPE VIRUS, EPIDEMIOLOGY',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2018-07-17-04_ab_54736.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(2435,'2021-09-01 07:44:47','2021-09-01 07:44:47','Classification of cacao germplasm using morphological characters and isozyme analysis.','1978-09-01','The genetic diversity of cacao germplasm established at the University of Southern Mindanao Agricultural Research Center, USM Kabacan, Cotabato was analyzed based on morphological descriptors and isozyme analysis using multivariate statistical methods. Thirty-nine morphological characters and 26 isozymic descriptors of six enzyme systems were used. Morphological cluster analysis identified three distinct clusters, which were represented mostly by the three groups of cacao, namely, Forastero, Criollo and Trinitario. These clusters differed significantly in fruit width/length ratio, fruit weight, fruit surface rugosity, fruit apex shape, seed length and width, average weight of dry seed and number of seeds per kilogram of cacao. The Trinitario group was closer to Criollo than Forastero based on 39 morphological characters. Calculated correlation coefficients of relevant parameters in cacao production like seed size (length, width and thickness) were significantly correlated with fruit length. Seed weight, on the other hand, is significantly correlated with seed size descriptors. As expected, negative correlation was detected between bean weight and number of beans per kilogram of cacao beans. Starch gel electrophoresis was also conducted to supplement or confirm the results obtained from morphological cluster analysis. Gel/electrode buffer systems A and B using extraction buffer I resolved consistently six enzyme systems. Malate dehydrogenase gave the sharpest band resolution with adequate definition. Acid phosphatase, alcohol dehydrogenase, esterase, isocitric dehydrogenase and peroxidae showed good and distinct band resolutions. Based on 26 electromorphs of six enzyme systems, the three clusters previously formed in morphological cluster analysis were not visible in the dendogram for isozyme analysis. Forastero-related cluster clones, which appeared as one group in morphological cluster analysis, did not appear as one group at the isozymic level; instead, they scattered themselves in the whole range of the dendogram. The Trinitario-and Criollo-related clones remained closely grouped together at approximately 0.697 similarity coefficient.

Significant differences were observed in mean percentage capsule set between reciprocals and  among crosses. N. tabacum exhibited normal bivalent pairing at diakinesis while N. glutinosa exhibited univalents ranging  from 2 to 18 per cell at a frequency of 26%. The other stages of meiosis in the two species were marked with relatively high frequencies of laggards but pollen fertility was high. It ranged from 85% to 96% in the six varieties of N. tabacum and 71% in N. glutinosa. The lower fertility of N. glutinosa was attributed to the occurrence of asynaptic/desynaptic condition from diakinesis to metaphase 1 of meiosis. The F1 interspecific hybrids exhibited a highly disturbed meiosis with the occurrence of laggards and bridges, unequal segregation, multiple spindle and micronuclei formation. Bivalent pairing at diakineses ranged from 0 to 12 pairs with two bivalents consistently occurring at high frequencies in most crosses. Genotypic differences among N. Tabacum varieties were indicated in varying frequencies of bivalents obtained in each cross combination. An efficienct interspecific breeding program, therefore, requires that many varieties are crossed to the wild species, followed by a thorough cytogenetic study of the hybrids to have a clear idea of the most effective cross combination. All the hybrids were sterile with less than 1% mean percentage pollen fertility. The F1 plants were morphologically different from either parent but more closely resembled N. tabacum in general plant stature, leaf shape and flower characteristics. Only 15% of the hybrids produced flowers after colchicines  treatment, 12.50% of which exhibited chromosome doubling but with highly irregular meiosis. Chromosome numbers observed in the doubled hybrids ranged from 60 to 72 indicating incomplete polyploidy and/or chromosome elimination. Absence of complete bivalent pairing was observed and seed capsules were produced in two of the three doubled hybrids. Ten F2 plants produced from the colchicines-derived seeds of N. glutinosa x Vizcaya exhibited a highly irregular meiosis. Two plants scored for diakinesis revealed a chromosome number of 72.

Water balance study under different water management practices assessed the effect of irrigation on the change of shallow groundwater table elevation. The water balance components were surface inflow (S.I.) and rainfall (R) as inflows, surface outflow (S.O.) and evaportranspiration (ET) as outflows, and change in surface storage (ASS), which included deep percolation as the difference between the inflows and the outflows. Water balance components and groundwater table elevations were observed and evaluated daily from January to June 1978 in an area of 1,096 ha at the South Zone of the Kabacan River Irrigation System (KABRIS). There were changes in the groundwater table behavior as there were shifts in the water management practices in the area. The groundwater table rose to a critical level  overtopping the ground surface at the drainage problem area during continuous irrigation. When rotational irrigation was employed (four-day opening and three-day closure), the water table exhibited periodic fluctuation, but did not reach the critical level. It was also observed that water was equitably distributed system wide with rotational irrigation. Using regression analysis, the change in the groundwater table elevation ( h) was a function of the change in surface storage ( SS). In general, the groundwater table elevation ceased to fluctuate when SS is within the range of 10-14 mm. Using multiple stepwise regression, the rise and fall of the water table was also affected by the number of days after the opening and closure of irrigation, respectively, and by rainfall whose effects lagged by one to two days.

Three Integrated Social Forestry (ISP) Projects in Region III, namely: San Miguel, Leyte; Calbiga, Western Samar; and  Gen. Mac Arthur, Eastern Samar were covered in this study. Out of 304 project  participants, 76 (25% of the total population) were taken as respondents. Data were gathered during field visits through personal interviews. The oldest and youngest in this study were 76 and 24 years old, respectively, with an overall mean age of 45. Majority (74%) of the respondents obtained elementary education, and had an average household size of seven. Annual income ranged from P2,000.00 to P29,600.00 or an average of P10,480.52. More than 90% were CSC holders. The mean ISF farm size of the respondents was 2.85 ha with an average distance of 2.21 kms from the residence. Majority (76%) had other landholdings with mean size of 2.31 ha. About 74% of the respondents had high level of perception toward agroforestry, mostly had positive attitude toward agroforestry system. Most of them aspired for better education for their children, better life and better or improved upland farming means of livelihood. Majority (74%) of the respondents attended an average of two trainings related to agroforestry. About 63% also received material support in farming. Over one-half (55%) of the respondents\' farms were visited by the ISF technician with an average visit of 8.00 times per year. Results showed that number of trainings attended, distribution of inputs and frequency of visit by the technician to the farmers\'  farm significantly influenced farmers\' decisions to adopt agroforestry. Hence, these factors must be given attention by the implementers of the ISF Projects. Problems the respondents encountered ranked according to the number of times mentioned were: lack of capital, planting materials, other farm inputs and time, unfair distribution of planting materials by the technician, destruction of planted crops by intruders and stray animals, poor technician\'s supervision, typhoon and drought.

The total developmental period of the cacao pod borer from egg laying up to adult emergence was observed as 28.78, on the average. The average duration of incubation, larval and pupal periods were 4.0, 16.92 and 7.86 days, respectively. The cacao pod borer was widely distributed in cacao growing areas in Mindanao. The assessed bean damage ranged from 5 to 98%. Three parasitoids namely, Paraphylax sp., Goryphus sp. and G. mesoxanthus Brulle were recorded from the pupae of the cacao pod borer, A. cramella Sn., the latter from rambutan and the other two were from cacao trees. Preliminary observation made on Paraphylax sp., showed low percentage parasitism ranging from 0 to 8.6%. Some ant predators identified as Monomorium  sp. were also observed preying on the pod borer pupae. These were new records for the Philippines. Rambutan, Nephelium lappaceum Linn., was observed as an alternate host of the cacao pod borer. Eggs were first noticed on the eight-week-old pods of the two cacao varieties studied, the mixed Malaysia hybrid and Trinitario, with a pod size of 7-8 cm long and 2-3 cm wide. The age of the pod most preferred for oviposition in mixed Malaysian hybrid was 17-18 weeks and 14-16 weeks in Trinitario. This study showed that egg disposition on cacao pods may be attributed to three factors: age, length and width of the pod. In mixed Malaysian hybrid, 43% of the egg deposited on the pods were influenced by these three factors and only 55% in Trinitario.

Correlation and stepwise multiple regression analyses were made and productivity indices were calculated. Analyses indicated that the influence of productivity factors on yield varied by type of irrigation and was mainly due to organic carbon, sodium and depth of the A-horizon. Individual regression showed that yields in both the irrigated and the rainfed areas were significantly related with the depth of the A-horizon, percent organic matter and sodium. The relationship with organic matter was curvilinear while that of depth was linear and that with sodium was negatively linear. Coefficient of determination for depth and organic matter accounted for 17.39% of the variations in yield per hectare. Combined with the depth of the A-Horizon, organic matter accounted for 17.03% of the variation in yield. Likewise, depth and total sodium content contributed 13.27% of the variation in yield. Most of the soil series studied were relatively average in productivity.  Balongay, Libmanan and Canaman series were rated very poor because of its high sodium content. The coefficient of improvement for most of these soil series ranged from two to four times. However, in the case of Balongay, Libmanan and Canaman, the coefficient of improvement can be classified as physical development of the area or the prevention of salt water intrusion. In general, the present productivity of the soils for rice studied could be similar should these improvements and management practices be employed. The only limiting element in the increased productivity of rice is soil depth not counting flooding of the immutable properties of the soil.

The study was conducted in three phases from January 1995 to March 1996. Phase I assessed the seriousness of the threat of land conversion to agricultural lands by collecting both primary and secondary data on the existing institutional arrangements, extent and nature of farmland conversion in Cavite. Phase II was a rapid rural appraisal on the effects of land conversion on different members of the local community using key informants from seven selected barangays which were most severely affected by land conversion. Phase III, on the other hand, delved on the financial and economic analysis of agricultural land conversion using the Benefit-Cost Analysis (BCA) approach. Results of the economic analysis were further subjected to sensitivity analysis. Frequency counts, averages, percentage distribution and performance ranking were used to process and analyze the data. At the time of the study, there were three principal government agencies which exercised varying jurisdictions on agricultural land conversion, namely, Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) and the local Assessor\'s Office. Based on the results, there were 856 recorded cases of land conversions in Cavite from 1986 to 1994 covering nearly 12,414 ha.  Of this number, about 698 petitions consisting of some 9,963 ha were either approved  or exempted. However, while this loss of agricultural lands may be regarded as sizable, it was not as serious and critical as widely thought of considering that it merely represented 10% of the total stock of agricultural lands in Cavite in 1986. Moreover, of the total area of farmlands converted, a greater part of the loss (95%) was composed mainly of the rainfed areas, of which some 30% were made up principally of idle lands. In terms of the impact of agricultural land conversion on the rural communities, the study found that among the different stakeholders, nonagricultural residents, local agricultural vendors, local public officials and private land developers reacted favorably to land conversion. In contrast, former tenants and those farmers who chose to remain in farming rated themselves as worse-off after land conversion. It was found that the effects of land conversion on local agriculture and rural communities varied across location, commodities, stakeholders and by type of effects. Based  on the results of the BCA, agricultural land conversion was both financially and economically justified. Even when the results were evaluated using different discount rates, time horizons and varying combinations of different agricultural lands converted, the winners have always gained more the losers lose and there were substantial positive net gains for society as a whole. Thus, in general, results of the study failed to support the popular notion that agricultural land conversion was detrimental to national interest. In fact, there is now some evidence that the positive side of land conversion can substantially offset its obvious disadvantages. Given, however, the serious implications of uncontrolled agricultural land conversions, the reader is advised to be cautious in relying on these data alone because of certain limitations of the study. Even so, the results are significant enough to suggest that the current extent and pattern of agricultural land conversions in Cavite are not as grim as they are often portrayed.',NULL,NULL,'De los Trinos, Cecilia H.','LIMNOLOGY, FISH CAGES, MAGAT HIGH DAM COMPLEX, Fisheries',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2018-06-29-02_ab_54727.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(2448,'2021-09-01 07:44:47','2021-09-01 07:44:47','Responses of ramie (Boehmeria nivea) to soil moisture stress and flooding.','1970-01-01','Two studies on moisture stress experiment and flooding determined the responses of ramie to soil moisture regimes. The moisture stress experiment made use of cylindrical drums as lysimeters while the flooding experiment was done using earthen pots (size 16). Moisture stress treatments involved different levels of water table depths and irrigation levels. Flooding treatments involved various growth stages subjected to duration of flooding. Ramie plants were established with two waste-cutting before the start of the study. Plant height, stalk weight and dry fiber yield of ramie at 25 and 50-cm water table depths were not significantly different to treatments of nonlimiting water supply (control) and 75% depletion of available moisture content (75 AMC). Water table depth at 70 cm and one irrigation right after cutting significantly reduced the height, stalk weight and dry fiber yield of ramie. Moisture stress had no significant effect on the fiber recovery and fiber diameter. Dry fiber yield and total water use were significantly correlated. The water requirement of ramie where water table was maintained between 25 and 50 cm below soil surface varied from 117.36 to 135.20 mm per 49 days. These were comparable to the total amount of water consumed by the 75 AMC and control treatments.

The respondent\'s assessment of the production activities within BICARRD of the primer was \"weak\" and \"lousy\". \"Weak\", because the activities were not properly coordinated. \"Lousy\", because decisions were complicated, thus, their participation was not maximized. The primer was disseminated intraregionally from the RACO 5 to BICARRD member agencies through the RACO officers, other agencies in the region and the DA 5 through its supervising information specialist (SIS). The primer was disseminated interregionally from RACO 5 to other RACOs. But since dissemination of print materials between RACOs was usually done during year-end reviews, and national meetings/trainings, the existing exchange mechanism of print materials was characterized by the respondents as irregular/slow/quite poor.  It was concluded that: 1) the BICARRD-RACOs system of producing print materials included the communication production activities mentioned earlier; 2) the expected participation of the project \"Strengthening...\" staff did not occur as expected; 3) the expected intraregional dissemination pattern occurred as expected between the levels of the SIS, PIOs and MAOs of Camarines Sur, Albay and Sorsogon; 4) the existing interconsortia exchange mechanism of print materials is irregular, slow and quite poor; and 5) the management-oriented and own work situation-oriented communication problems encountered in producing and disseminating the primer were due to the ineffective coordination of the human resource of the project, and the staff\'s part-time service to the consortium. For the management-oriented problems, it was recommended that: 1) proper coordination among member-agencies be observed in communication production activities and dissemination of print materials; 2) the implementation stage of these activities, the RACO coordinator should work closely with the RACO team and the project staff and the clientele; 3) RACO activities should be supported by BICARRD, i.e., by the RRDCC and RTWG; 4) the consortium should provide for the honoraria of RACO members and regular staff; 5) a continuous staff development program should be instituted; 6) a systematic method/formalized system of disseminating print materials should be observed and implemented with regular budget allocations, i.e., for postage; 7) the consortium should provide regular funding to RACO activities and 8) each RACO should provide other RACOs with a list of different publications for intra and interregional dissemination. For the own work situation-oriented problem, it was recommended that staff should utilize as many appropriate channels, i.e., meetings, office visits, memoranda, telecommunications, as possible.',NULL,NULL,'Clarete, Celso L.','RICE, FERTILIZER APPLICATION, SPACING, WEED CONTROL, CROP YIELD, Science and technology',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2018-12-03-01_ab_54694.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(2451,'2021-09-01 07:44:47','2021-09-01 07:44:47','Foraging and nesting behavior of giant bee (Apis dorsata Fab.) in various agricultural and forest ecosystems in Northern Luzon, Philippines.','1996-09-01','The study was conducted in seven types of ecosystems: dipterocarp, mangrove, molave, mossy, pine, agro-forest, and open agricultural areas from 1995 to 1997. The main objective was to determine the habitat, behavior and productivity of the giant bee, Apis dorsata, in Northern Luzon, Philippines. Data were collected through questionnaire and personal observations on actual wild honey hunting and collecting within the survey area: the Cordillera Administrative Region, Region I and II. A. dorsata nests were observed in all three regions, but most abundantly in CAR; among the provinces the nests were most abundant in Benguet. The bees preferred to build nest in dipterocarp forest, followed by agro-forest, mixed dipterocarp-pine forest and mangrove forest. No nests were observed in pine, mossy and molave forests and in agricultural areas without nest trees. Apart from vegetation, the distribution and abundance of A. dorsata were influenced by climatic conditions. Preferred nest trees have smooth and fine textured barks such as Alnus japonica (alnus), Ptercarpus indicus (narra), Tamarindus indica (sampalok), Chrysophyllum cainito (caimito), Ficus balete (balete), Saurauia elegans (\"uyoc\") and Leucaena leucocephala (ipil-ipil). A nest trunk is oriented in any direction, inclined from 10  to 50? and has a diameter of 15 to 30 cm, above ground height of .01 to 12 m and a length of at least 2 m. The bee builds only one comb and only one nest on a tree. The size of the colony or comb and the weight of the honey and pollen vary depending on the age of the nest at harvest. The color of the honey and pollen also vary depending on the floral season. A. dorsata is less ferocious as they are commonly perceived to be. Foraging starts late in the morning and ends early in the afternoon. The colony absconds when the temperature changes abruptly, the nest is queenless or infested with varroa mites or when pollen sources become scarce.

Gerd. and Trappe. Production at three different phases was studied namely, mother inoculum under axenic conditions, mother and starter inocula using plastic tumbler and Leonard jar under growth room conditions, and mass inoculum production in \"pot culture\" under screenhouse conditions. During the conduct of the experiment modifications, some of the techniques employed by other VAM researchers were made. Optimization of cultivation conditions were made for each technique which was the most suitable for the production of mother, starter and mass inocula. The technique using Leonard jar was an alternative method to axenic culture for producing high quality mother and starter inocula. This  technique used locally available materials such as dextrose bottles, corn as the host plant, and perlite amended with diluted nutrient solution as the potting substrate. The nutrient solution composition had an important effect on VAM morphology, the effect differing somewhat among the techniques examined. In general, at high concentrations of N and P neither arbuscules nor vesicles were formed. Both became prominent with increasing dilution of these two elements in nutrient solution. Increasing amounts of K, Ca, and Mg from 20 ppm up to 60 ppm had no remarkable effect on VAM colonization. For mass inoculum production, among the 25 host and potting medium combinations evaluated, Luisiana clay grown with onion favored the production of spores which could be stored. Perlite was the most suitable potting medium for inoculum to be transported since this medium was ten times lighter than the ordinary soil media. The results of the experiment on the effect of fertilization confirmed that successful colonization of the root system and spore production by G. mossseae required an adequate and balanced supply of N, P, and K. The amount and proportion of these nutrients needed for maximum production of inoculum in pot culture depended on the host and potting substrate combinations.',NULL,NULL,'Valeroso, Manuel L.','LAND TRANSFERS, REPAYMENTS, NUEVA ECIJA, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2019-01-16-08_ab_54719.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(2453,'2021-09-01 07:44:47','2021-09-01 07:44:47','Field and laboratory studies on the effectiveness of dungs for the control of plant parasitic nematodes on cowpeas.','1983-09-01','Under farmer\'s field condition, preplanting broadcast application of 14-14-14 fertilizer (39-39-39 kg/ha), Nemacur (3.9 kg. a.i./ha), 14-14-14 fertilizer and Nemacur (same rates as above), and carabao, chicken, cow, horse and pig dungs (at rates twice to four times the recommended rate of 40 kg/ha) did not influence nematode populations and cowpea yield during the first cropping period (wet season). In the succeeding dry season, increasing the application rates per hectare of Nemacur (at 18.8 kg. a.i./ha), carabao, chicken, horse (each at 14.6 and 29.2 t), cow (at 29.2 and 58.4 t), and pig (at 7.3 and 14.6 t) dungs, significantly reduced the field populations of plant paraitic nematodes with no significant differences in effect between application levels. Compared to the check, yield significantly increased (10% level) only in plots receiving both the low ang high rates of chicken dung. Application of 14-14-14 fertilizer alone did not affect nematode population and cowpea yield. Economic analysis showed added returns per hectare of P6,481.88 and P5,995.21 from the low and high rates of chicken dung applications, respectively. Lesser added returns resulted from application of carabao (low and high rates, P547.24 and P642.90) and horse (high rate, P275.69) dungs.

The study showed that the broilers fed diets with skinned-uncooked and unskinned-cooked toad meals had growth and feed conversion ratio as good as those on the fish meal diet. Analogous trends were noted on the overall organoleptic properties of the roasted breasts of broilers. Dressing percentage, liver weight and feed consumption obtained were similar in all the dietary treatments. All the toad meal diets were as profitable as the fish meal, although the skinned-cooked toad meal diet was slightly lower in return above feed cost than the other treatments. Likewise, comparable results were noted on the egg production, egg size, egg mass, feed consumption, feed conversion ration, mortality and final weight of layers on the processed toad meal and fish meal diets. The same observation was obtained from the other parameters of egg quality, specifically in Haugh unit scores and shell thickness, except in yolk color where the unskinned-uncooked and unskinned-cooked toad meal diets were significantly better than the conventional fish meal. The eating quality of the boiled eggs from all the dietary treatments were all normally acceptable. Organoleptic evaluations for flavor, color and overall acceptability were significantly higher for toad meals with skin intact than the fish meal. On the return above feed cost from eggs, three toad meals (UUTM, UCTM and SCTM) were higher than the fish meal counterpart. The skinned-uncooked toad meal was slightly lower than the rest of the dietary treatments. With these evidences and since there was no serious objectionable response brought about by the processed toad meals, it could be disclosed that all the toad meal preparations were as good as or even better than the fish meal in enhancing the performance of broilers and layers.

This pest caused drying and dropping of flowers and young fruits by sucking the sap of the inflorescences. Relatively similar life cycle was observed on both sexes. The incubation period of the eggs was 4.62 ? 0.50 days in males. Four nymphal instars were recorded. The total duration of the nymphal stage was 10.12 ? 0.95 days in females and 10.04 ? 0.98 days in males. The total developmental period, egg laying to adult emergence, were 14.73 ? 1.08 days in females and 14.64 ? 1.08 days in males, respectively. The adults were present in the mango trees throughout the year. Eggs were laid exclusively at the calcyces of the flower buds. The nymphs developed only on mango and paho inflorescences. The total number of eggs laid by a female adult throughout her oviposition period ranged from 60 to 212 eggs with a mean of  152.7 ? 42.5 eggs. Percentage egg hatchability varied from 85% to 100%, `x = 95.20 ? 4.40%. Life span of the female ranged from 14 to 315 days, `x = 127.8 ? 96.2 days while the male\'s longevity ranged from 14 to 308 days, `x = 123.9 ? 91.4 days. Rapid increase in the population of adults and nymphs coincided with the flowering period. The nymphal population reached its peak on the inflorescences at about 24-27 days after bud break (DAFBB) while the peak of adult population occurred 30-40 DAFBB. Young but fully developed leaves attracted adult leafhoppers resulting in the second type of population peak. The economic threshold level was about 40 nymphs at ten DAFBB. Normally, the adults reproduced only during the flowering season. However, when flowers were induced during off-flowering season, July to September, the female adults were able to breed on the flowers but to a limited extent. In the absence of flowers, the adults fed and were able to survive on mango leaves until the next flowering season. Egg, nymphal instars and male and female adults were described. The pest attacked mango, Mangifera indica L., and paho, Mangifera altissima Blanco. Nine species of spiders preyed on the nymphs of I. clypealis. A species of ant belonging to subfamily Formicinae fed on the nymphs. An unidentified fungal disease attacked the adults. Light trapping was more effective during dark nights.

Fish were divided into three sections: upper, middle and lower to detect the distribution of lipids in their body. The belly portion was analyzed separately since it had the main fat storage of milkfish. The lipid content of BW fish as a whole averaged 4.91% while that from FW was 4.51%. These values represented only the gutted fish and since visceral organs contain lipids, values for the non-eviscerated fish was expected to be greater. Both types of milkfish were classified under fatty species. The upper and middle sections contained 2.23% (BW), 2.13% (FW) and 2.43% (BW), 2.18% (FW) lipids, respectively, while the lower section had only 0.26% (BW), 0.195% (FW). The belly portion on the other hand, had an average percent lipid of 2.84 (BW) and 2.64 (FW). The distribution of lipids in the fish body was concentrated more in the upper and middle sections rather than that of the lower section. Iodine values, saponification number, specific gravity and the nonsaponifiable matters of the total lipids were taken to further characterize the BW and FW fish. The BW-bred fish exhibited an average iodine value of 91.71 while the FW fish had 89.43 g I/100 g fat. The results signified greater unsaturation in the total lipids of BW bangus. Saponification number showed almost the same values for BW and FW total fish lipids (100.23 and 101.68 mg KOH/g fat, respectively). Results indicated that FW fats have shorter average chain lengths compared to the BW type. The amount of nonsaponifiable matters in both types of fish were only minimal (0.96% for BW and 0.91% for FW). Specific gravity of BW bangus oil averaged to 0.914 while that of FW oil reached an average value of 0.945. Separation of lipids into different classes via column and thin layer chromatographies showed the presence of the following saponifiable fractions: neutral lipids, phospholipids and glycolipids. Neutral lipids accounted for 67% (FW) and 77% (BW) whereas phospholipids 26% (FW) and 34% (BW), of the total lipids in the whole fish. Glycolipids were present in very minimal amounts. The FW type fish showed lower values for the three classes of lipids as compared with BW fish. The belly section contained 51% (BW) and 42% (FW) of neutral lipids and 21% phospholipids in both FW and BW bangus. Further separation of the neutral lipids showed mostly triglycerides and cholesterol esters and only minor amounts of monoglycerides, diglycerides and free fatty acids. Iodine values of the neutral lipid fraction was lower for BW fish (47.22) than for FW fish (48.96). Neutral lipids of FW bangus then showed greater unsaturation than the BW type. The results indicated that other lipids were responsible for the high unsaturation found in the total lipids of the BW type in the previous results. GLC analysis of the fatty acid esters of the neutral lipid fractions showed the following results: The total saturated fatty acids were higher and the total unsaturated fatty acids lower, in BW-bred bangus than with FW bangus. The total saturated fatty acids amounted to 38.84% (BW) and 55.49% (FW) while the unsaturated were 61.01% (BW) and 64.30% (FW). Palmitic and stearic acids (C16 and C18) were the most predominant saturated fatty acids in both BW and FW fish. Lauric and myristic acids (C12 and C14) were present in traceable amount in both types of fish. Arachidic and behenic acids (C20 and C22) were present in smaller amounts. C15 was the lone odd-numbered saturated fatty acid found, likewise, in traceable amount. Lignoceric acid (C24) was found only in BW fish and only in the cholesterol ester fraction. The C16 and C18 unsaturated fatty acids were characteristics more of the BW bangus while the C20 and C22 acids comprised majority of the fatty acid components of BW fish.

The pH (1:1 soil-water of the air-dried soil samples collected from the pond bottom and along the dikes of the nursery ponds ranged from 2.2 to 4.6. This was significantly correlated with the lime requirement, extractable A1, active Fe and Mn, acetate-soluble sulfate and total sulfur content of the soil. Before lime treatment, the waters of the nursery ponds in the field experiment decreased in pH with time, and decreased dissolved Al and Fe concentration. There was low Mn level in the water because of the small amount of active Mn present in the soil. Acidity in the pondwaters after a heavy rain was mainly due to the leaching of sulfuric acid from the dikes. Three lime treatments were used in the study: I - 1 t/ha of lime applied along the dikes and 3 t/ha on the pond bottom, II - 3 t/ha of lime on dikes and 1 t/ha on the pond bottom, III - 4 t/ha of lime on dikes and no lime on the pond bottom. Treatment II was the most effective treatment because it had the highest mean water pH. Fish died in one of the ponds (NP10 in Treatment III) which may be traceable to the low pH and high Al concentration in the pondwater. The applied lime on the dike did not control the acidity because it was washed by the rains and covered with eroded soil.

Results showed that higher percentage recovery of dried WHLPC can be obtained from coarse plate grinding, washing once with 10:1 water to solid ratio at pH 8. Sedimentation and oven drying also gave higher percentage recovery. In the feeding trial, a total of 420 day-old broiler chicks of commercial strain were randomly distributed to three systems of feeding of five dietary treatments each group.

Most of them had low education, low income and low association membership. All lived in the barangay since birth. Among the members of the barangay council, the barangay captain had the highest level of awareness of duties and responsibilities as provided for in R.A. 3590. He also had a high level of awareness of development information and projects ongoing outside and within the barangay. Owing to his position in the barangay, he was predisposed to act as conveyor of need information from the people to higher levels of government and of resolution information to the barangay. All barangay officials enjoyed status from, aside their government position, membership in at least one association in the barangay, which exposed them to group interaction and interpersonal communication. They generally thought their government position beneficial and generally perceived their functions as oriented to the development of the barangay. All were highly exposed to mass media information and found them useful source of development information. Majority of the resident respondents had low education and did not derive economic status from their low income and lack of sizeable land or fishpen ownership. A majority of the resident respondents were not aware of development elements introduced in the barangay such as the Biyayang Dagat Program (bank loan facilities for improvement of fishing operation), existence of barangay fund for development projects such as road repair and the increase in the amount of tax exemption for heads of families.  Very few contacted the barangay officials, municipal official and government  agency technicians to communicate their problems. Majority thought the barangay council members were incapable of cooperative action on account of political disparities existing among them. This  obstructed the flow of development information from up-down and down-up to higher levels of resolutions. The horizontal flows among the members of the council and between them and the barangay captain also suffered as they hardly communicated and never met officially. Majority of the resident respondents had low association membership and had less opportunity for formal group communication for development.

Three potential markets for cassava were analyzed: food, feed and the starch market. The results of the food demand analysis showed that cassava root consumed as food was -0.82. Rice and cassava roots were found as substitute goods as indicated by the positive cross-price elasticity coefficient. The elasticity coefficient of cassava use with respect to the price of rice was 1.18. The results of the seasonal price variation analysis also showed that rice and cassava were substitutes. A high seasonal index for cassava price was observed during rice off-season months, suggesting that more cassava was consumed when rice was scarce. The inclusion of dried cassava in mixed feeds was only possible if the price of cassava was very much lower relative to the price of corn than has been the case in the past. The price of protein sources was also a prime determinant since inclusion of cassava in feed rations required more protein sources. Regularity of cassava supply should also be considered because shifting feed mix involved cost. If supply was not regular, feedmillers preferred not to use cassava, even if it was relatively cheaper. The market potential for starch looked good. Cassava starch consumption increased faster than corn starch consumption. A fall in the price of cassava relative to corn increased the share of cassava starch to total starch supply.  Cassava starch production was also very responsive to cassava root price decline as shown by the value of the elasticity estimate (-1.77) for cassava root price and starch production. The results of the analysis suggested that the potential demand for cassava roots in the future depend on relative price changes of cassava and other feed ingredients, income growth, reduction in the cost of production and improved regularity of supply.',NULL,NULL,'Castillo, Stellavilla A.','GMELINA ARBOREA, PINUS KESIYA, PAPERMAKING, Forestry',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2474,'2021-09-01 07:44:47','2021-09-01 07:44:47','The effect of stocking densities on the growth, survival and reproduction on intensively fed nile tilapia in brackishwater ponds.','1979-09-01','Four stocking densities of Tilapia nilotica were evaluated in twelve 100 sq m brackishwater ponds of the UP College of Fisheries  Brackishwater Aquaculture Center, Leganes, Iloilo from August 1 to November 28, 1980 (120 culture days).

A mutual depressive effect of P and Zn on each other was observed. Zinc uptake increased with Zn fertilization and decreased with P fertilization; P uptake increased with P fertilization and decreased with Zn fertilization.  The effect of the micronutrient Zn on plant growth and development was demonstrated. A very small amount of added Zn equivalent to 2.5-5.0 kg/ha resulted in a very high net growth rate of 300-500 ml of dry matter yield per week. At zero P, the magnitude of growth of corn plants was several thousand times more than the rate of Zn uptake. The application of 45 kg P/ha did not significantly affect Zn availability; and 90 and 180 kg of P decreased Zn availability. Exchangeable Ca decreased significantly with increasing levels of P and not with Zn. A highly significant negative correlation existed between added P and exchangeable Ca indicating ion antagonism between the two elements. Tissue Ca as influenced by added P and Zn behaved like that of exchangeable Ca. Dry matter yield attributable to P alone was about twice as much as that because of Zn alone suggesting the dominant influence of P on dry matter accumulation over that of Zn. The optimum combination of lime and Zn that gave favorable response in terms of dry matter yield was determined. Kernel yield increased significantly as added Zn  was increased at the three-ton lime treatment. Apparently increasing lime beyond 3 t/ha adversely affected Zn solubility and its availability to plants causing a low Zn uptake and resulted to a reduction in kernel yield. Among the levels of Zn in the three-ton lime treatment, 6 kg Zn gave the highest kernel yield followed by the 8 kg of added Zn. Based on these results, lime-zinc combinations that gave optimum kernel yield of corn in Adtuyon clay were the 3-6 and 3-8 combinations.

In terms of percent runoff of the total rainfall, sweet potato gave an average of 2.69%; natural vegetation, 3.38%; para grass + centrosema mixture, 3.77%; para grass, 4.56%; guinea grass, 6.61%; centrosema, 7.04%; stylo, 11.13%; corn + stylo, 21.58%; corn, 36.30% and the bare plot, 44.86%. Soil loss was positively correlated with surface runoff (r = 0.98). The bare plot gave the highest amount of soil loss, 22.87 t/ha during the three-month obsevation period. Among the planted plots, the corn treatment produced the greatest amount of soil loss with 14.73 t/ha. The para grass treatment was the most effective in reducing soil erosion with only 0.07 t/ha soil loss. No significant changes within the short period of observation were observed in the physical and chemical properties of the soil as a result of the imposition of the different vegetal cover.

Fertilization significantly increased the degree of mycorrhizal infection, tuber dry weight and total dry matter yield regardless of inoculation and liming treatments. In unlimed but fertilized soils, inoculation significantly increased P uptake. Among fertilized treatments, no significant growth response was obtained from liming and inoculation. Using Lipa clay loam and Luisiana clay, the response of cassava to NPK fertilization and mycorrhizal inoculation was further investigated. The application of 45-60-60 in both soil types significantly increased tuber dry weight and total dry matter yield.  A significant increase in P uptake over the 0-60-60 treatment was observed in Lipa clay loam and Luisiana clay applied with 45-60-60 and 90-60-60, respectively. Nitrogen and potassium uptakes were not significantly affected by NPK levels in both soil types. Mycorrhizal inoculation apparently increased the degree of mycorrhizal infection in Luisiana clay but not in Lipa clay loam. In both experiments, results of correlation analyses showed that the degree of mycorrhizal infection was not related to shoot uptakes of N, P and K, dry weight of tubers and total dry matter yield of cassava.

VHT of carabao mango induced the development of internal breakdown with 13.3% incidence in mature to 100% in immature fruits. Affected fruits significantly exhibited low pH, titratable acidity (TA), total soluble solids (TSS), reduced flesh firmness and distinct white starchy lesions with either or both air pockets and fermented odor. The base to the middle portions of the fruit were sensitive to IB. The prolonged and elevated temperature during VHT increased respiration, caused alteration in the activities of enzymes, damaged membranes of fruit tissues which lead to abnormal metabolic processes and consequently result in the development of internal breakdown during ripening. The markedly high activities of polygalaturonase (PG) and pectinmethylesterase (PME) lead to abnormal softening while reduced alpha-amylase activity resulted in incomplete hydrolosis of starch to sugars. The high respiration of fruits caused oxygen depletion and CO2 accumulation which may partly be but not totally anaerobic. Both high VHT temperature and low oxygen inhibited ethylene production which possibly resulted in low adenosine triphosphate (ATP) formation and production of alcohol and acetaldehyde. VHT inhibited the activity of ethylene-forming enzyme (EFE), reduced internal ethylene and increased the levels of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC). Inhibition of EFE activity, due to high temperature and presumably anaerobiosis, may directly or indirectly inhibit ethylene production since the conversion of ACC to ethylene requires the presence of ATP, EFE and oxygen. Inhibition of ethylene as a ripening hormone led to abnormal metabolic reactions and development of IB. Disintegration of mango tissues due to VHT caused high ACC accumulation, electrolyte leakage and inhibited ethylene production. VHT induced the synthesis of heat shock proteins (HSPs) with molecular weights between 35,000-41,000 daltons. A proposed scheme on the underlying mechanism of HT-induced IB was presented.

The data were gathered from 265 root crop growers. Means and percentages were used to describe the characteristics and technology adopted by the farmers. Analysis of variance  and the Duncan\'s Multiple Range Test were used to compare the three groups of root crop growers. Chi-square determined the relationship of variables under study. The root crop growers were middle-aged, predominantly males, married with low educational attainment and came from a family of seven members.

Communication-wise, the root crop growers had low exposure to radio, print and interpersonal sources. Likewise, their access to market, transportation facilities and credit was relatively low. The finding also revealed that in terms of the technology adopted, the root crop growers were modern as to the varieties planted, system of land preparation, cultivation and weeding practices. There was significant differences between the three groups of farmers, i.e., the cassava group differed significantly from both the sweet potato and gabi farmers.

Pulog. The Kalanguya shifting cultivation, now impinging on the jurisdiction of Mt. Pulog, was seen as traditional swiddening as it followed the cycle of site selection, clearing, burning, planting and fallowing; the num-an was also an indigenous intercropping system and was integral in nature, since it was a community-wide and ritually sanctioned way of life with gods and spirits to whom prayers were said for favors or permission. Kalanguya society was also seen as imbued with adaptive traditionalism, as it had imbibed social, cultural, political and technological developments from the outside, and continue to do so, while it remained reasonably similar to itself. This ethnolinguistic group said they would protest as a people if the mountain is declared a national park by the Government. Mt. Pulog was a sacred grove to them, their own Land of the Hereafter. It was also a sacred grove to modern Filipinos, who were thereby merely borrowing the western idea of conservation. Thus, conflict seemed inevitable, given time. Fortunately, the two models can be integrated into one; that is, Mt. Pulog can be declared another protected anthropological area with the park and the people living in some harmonious way. A possible key to such a policy was to contain the Kalanguya within the confines of their territorial boundaries and to encourage sedentary, intensive cultivation of the land, using the technology mix of their very own multiple cropping, the vegetable gardening of the Ibaloi and the terracing of the Ifugao, as the last two are in fact technologies at the trial stage right now with young Kalanguya as innovators themselves.

Sweet corn was resistant to the first two nematodes but susceptible to the third. All crops were resistant to the other nematode genera (Criconemoides, Hemicroconemoides, Hemicycliophora, Hoplolaimus, Pratylenchus, Tylenchorhynchus and Xiphinema). Mustard and radish were resistant to M. incognita, H. erythrinae and the other nematode genera, but susceptible to R. reniformis. Peanut was resistant to R. reniformis, M. incognita and H. erythrinae, but susceptible to other nematode genera, presumably Criconemoides and Hemicroconemoides. On resistant crops, the nematode populations remained relatively low throughout the cropping period. On susceptible crops, populations were generally high and trends varied with initial nematode density. With low initial density, populations changed only slightly or increased gradually during the early period of cropping, then steadily and drastically increased toward midcropping, followed by a decline toward the last harvest. With high initial density, populations either declined, or assumed relatively constant high stable populations, or assumed other variations. Based on statistical analyses (ANOVA) of yield differences between phenamiphos-treated and nontreated subplots, significant yield reductions presumably due to R. reniformis and M. incognita were: 41.9, 35.2 and 92.1% for mungbean, soybean and tomato, respectively, during the early wet season; 37.1 and 37.5% for cowpea and tomato, during the wet season; 44.2, 45.2, 50.0 and 49.8% for cowpea, mungbean, soybean and tomato, respectively, during the dry season.

The client system consisted of 170 housewives representing households selected randomly from barangays Sta. Ana and San Antonio II in San Pablo City. The data were gathered using the case study and the survey methods. The study showed a generally high level of interagency communication as manifested through individual, group and mass contacts and a relatively high extent of interagency coordination exhibited through joint projects and activities. Since interagency communication and coordination operated on a lead agency concept with each agency leading in each program component, the management and supervisory staff provided the rallying point for the interagency set-up. Functional consequences of interagency communication and coordination were evidenced by the presence of activities performed and resources made available as planned under the integrated rural development program. Despite the low level of living of the client system, the study showed a relatively active social participation and favorable attitudes towards rural efforts. Likewise, organizational factors, both interorganizational and intraorganizational, served as inputs and facilitated the interagency communication and coordination of participating entities under the integrated rural development program utilizing nutrition as entry point. The local indigenous channels particularly the barangay captain, councilmen, and the BIDWs played significant linkage roles in the interagency set-up under the IRD program.

Existing rambutan cropping practices in Cotabato, Region XII were also documented. Bearing and nonbearing rambutan trees intercropped with grain legumes were taller and had bigger stem and canopy diameter than monocropped rambutan and those associated with corn. Rambutan + mungo and rambutan + peanut gave the highest Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) of 2.24 (1993) and 2.10 (1994), respectively, but the highest economic return in all cropping season was obtained in rambutan + corn cropping system. Two croppings of grain legumes and corn with bearing rambutan trees significantly increased soil organic matter (OM) from 1.0 to 1.6% but hardly changed pH, P and CEC of soil at 15 cm depth. At 30 cm depth, soil OM and P did not change while  K decreased. In nonbearing trees, only soil OM at 30 cm depth increased significantly from 1.0 to 1.6% after two croppings. Competition for soil moisture was not pronounced in all cropping seasons and crop combination. The presence of rambutan did not minimize pod borer infestation in mungo and corn borer in corn. Peanut generally gave higher yield during wet season while soybean did not show any definite pattern. Grain yield of mungo and corn was not affected by season. All intercrops gave higher TDM yield during wet season and showed yield reduction when associated with bearing rambutan.

For the equilibrium activity ratio (AReK), the soils  followed the order: Bantog > Luisiaa > San Manuel > Bigaa. The labile K determined from the Q/I relations was highest in Bantog (0.43 me/100 g). All the three other soils exhibited deficit in the labile K. Due to higher CEC, Bantog and Bigaa had higher PBCK indicating greater capacity of the soil to maintain a given K intensity in the soil solution despite removal by crops. Addition of K increased the AReK but not the PBCK of the soils. Likewise, there was an increase in exchangeable K (Kex) with K application. Significant correlation coefficeint (R) was obtained between AReK and Kex, AReK and levels of K and Kex and levels of K.

Potassium fertilizer in the field experiment significantly increased plant height in Bantog and yield in Bigaa. Nitrogen (N) fertilization increased the leaf area, number of harvested leaves, yield and crop value in Bigaa. Nitrogen also increased the leaf area and yield but decreased specific leaf weight and grade index in Bantog. However, there was inverse relation between plant height and amount of N applied in San Manuel. There was a significant interaction on N x K on leaf area in Bantog and specific leaf weight in San Manuel. Results of the regression analysis of the different gowth and yield parameters and crop value and grade index with AReK and Kex indicated relative usefulness of the two soil K parameters. In general, K did not affect the nicotine or reducing sugar content of the flue-cured tobacco leaves. On the other hand, N application increased the nicotine content of leaves while the reducing sugar content of leaves decreased.',NULL,NULL,'Dawi, Nicolas M.','BANANAS, PEST CONTROL, CURCULIONIDAE, BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY, Zoology',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2493,'2021-09-01 07:44:47','2021-09-01 07:44:47','Effects of foliar sprays of urea on the growth of calamandarin seedlings.','1984-09-01','About 720 one-year old calamandarin (Citrus madurensis x  Citrus reticulata) seedlings were used to determine the effects of foliar application of urea at different levels of N (25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 ppm) and frequency of spraying (every two, four and eight  weeks).

This study quantified and assessed the importance of the factors affecting the adoption of the rice threshing technology. A conceptual framework based on induced innovation theory was developed to explain adoption. It was hypothesized that the relative cost of labor (manual threshing) and capital (mechanical threshing), production, tenure status, farm size, farming experience, rainfall, distance from urban center and contractual arrangement in harvesting/threshing were major factors affecting adoption decision. This study used a pooled 1978 and 1981 wet season survey data for 187 randomly drawn sample farmers from four municipalities of Laguna, Philippines. The sample consisted of 136 nonowner thresher user and 51 nonowner nonthresher user farms. Since it was only  known whether the sample farmer used or did not use the treshing machine, the dependent variable was represented by a dummy variable (1 if the farmer used the thresher, 0 otherwise). A binary logit model estimated by nonlinear maximum likelihood procedure was used in quantifying the effects of the hypothesized variables because it could overcome most of the statistical difficulties associated with applying an ordinary least squares regression approach. In the logit model, the predicted value of the dependent variable was interpreted as a probability, i.e., confined to the unit interval. Simple descriptive statistics between thresher user and nonuser farms showed that on the average, the former generally have bigger farm size, higher rice output, nearer the urban or thresher supply center and with higher manual: mechanical threshing cost ratio than the latter. Both farm categories, however, were predominantly leaseholders, \'gama\' adoptors and almost of the same length of farming experience. Logit analysis indicated that the mechanical thresher adoption decision was positively associated with manual: mechanical threshing cost ratio, production, tenure status and negatively associated with distance from urban center and farm size. Sensitivity analyses determined the relative importance of the variables associated with the logarithm of the odds of machine adoption. Results showed that regardless of tenural and contractual arrangements and depending upon one\'s initial probability of thresher adoption, and the values of the attribute variable, the change in the distance from urban center showed that highest partial effect on the probability of thresher adoption. It was followed by farm size, production and the manual: mechanical threshing cost ratio variables. Moreover, using the estimated logit model, and given the magnitudes of ranges and values of the different variables, the probability level of thresher adoption for an individual farmer was also determined using the mean characteristics of the Laguna farmers as a whole. This exercise identified the conditions under which a farmer will be less likely, likely or most likely to adopt the threshing machine. The impact of several policy alternatives on the number of thresher adoptors among the sample farmers were also examined. When policies were individually considered, a  policy for the improvement of accessibility of threshing machines to farmers had the largest impact on increasing the number of thresher adoptors. The effect of combined policies were larger than the sum of the effects of each policy in isolation. The research findings cited above were restricted only to four municipalities in Laguna which are not necessarily typical of rice farms in the Philippines. The methodology, however, can be expanded to other rice farms in the Philippines if one wants to study at the country level, the impact of farm size, tenure status, seasonal differences, water regimes, contractual arrangements and threshing machine accessibility on thresher adoption.',NULL,NULL,'Dazon, Preston M.','POTATOES, SOIL TYPES, PLANT SOIL RELATIONS, FERTILIZER APPLICATION, NITROGEN, CROP YIELD, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2495,'2021-09-01 07:44:47','2021-09-01 07:44:47','An analysis of some economic factors affecting wood production in giant ipil-ipil (Leucaena leucocephala Lam de Wit) tree farms in Lanao Province.','1983-09-01','This study aimed to: 1) determine the present levels of input resources and the corresponding output of giant ipil-ipil tree farms; 2) obtain statistical estimates of the productivities of the different factors of production in these tree farms; 3) determine the alternative level of single and combination of resources for a given level of production  under given factor-product price ratio; and 4) suggest policy measures that can help in the efficient management and development of giant ipil-ipil tree farming business. A sample or 65 giant ipil-ipil tree farmers in Lanao province were included in the  analysis. Data were gathered through personal interviews of the plantation owners with the aid of prepared interview schedules from May to June 1982. The  Cobb-Douglas production function was used to fit a model for the input output data. The standard least squares multiple regression techniques was employed. The average tree farm area of giant ipil-ipil was 6.68 ha. The average capital investment per hectare was P398.31 excluding the value of land. If the value of land was assumed as P2,800.00/ha, then the total capital investment made per hectare was P3,198.00. Man-labor utilization per hectare averaged 177.9 man-days. Planting and harvesting operations were the major operations requiring 60% of  the total amount of man-labor utilization. Wood production from these tree farms was positively and significantly related with all the input categories included in the regression, namely, tree farm area, labor, cash operating expenses, and investment on tools and equipment. The sum of coefficients (b\'s) representing elasticities of production was 1.01, indicating an increasing returns to scale. This finding suggests that from an economic point of view, a one percent increase in the current use of four input categories would increase wood production by 1.01%. Land exhibited the highest elasticities of production of 0.6009. The marginal value product of this input at the geometric mean was still significantly higher than its marginal input cost. Elasticities of production for operating expenses and tools and equipment were 0.1064 and 0.1146, respectively. At their geometric means, their marginal value products were greater than marginal costs. Man-labor expenses exhibited a little bit higher elasticities of production but their marginal value product was lower than the marginal costs. Findings implied, that there is a need to increase the farm area, operating expenses, and investment on tools and equipment but there is a need to reduce the employment of man-labor.

The milking animals were tethered primarily on cogonal pasture and supplemented with roughage from crop residues and weeds from the farm during the rainy season. They were supplemented with ipil-ipil leaves during the dry season. The kind of roughage supplement given was dependent on the cropping pattern in the area. The roughage the animals consumed met the estimated digestible protein (DP) requirement. However, the estimated total digestible nutrient (TDN) in dry season were not met in idle milking carabaos and cows. Estimated total disgetible nutrient requirements in milking carabaos doing hard work were not met during dry and wet seasons. The DP and TDN required to produce 1.4 kg milk (5.3%  B. P.) in cows were 0.1 and 0.5 kg, respectively; in carabaos, 0.1 kg DP and 0.6 kg TDN were required to produce 1.1 kg milk (10.4% BP). The dams were milked when the calves were three weeks to three months old, depending on the choice of the farmer.  Before milking, the calves were allowed to go with the dams at all times. At the start of milking, the calves were separated from the dam for 12-23.5 hours before milking depending on their age. Generally, the older the calf, the less the number of hours it was allowed to stay with the dam after milking. The calves were used for milk-let-down, one to two times per milking. Most farmers (63%) had milking experience and milked their animals themselves. Most cows in the area were inseminated with Holstein frozen semen and were impregnated. Two Holstein bulls were loaned to the farmers by DTRI. An animal health technician and a veterinarian assigned by DTRI controlled the pests and diseases of the milking animals. They conducted periodic vaccination and veterinary visits. Only 15% of the farmers recorded production and income from milk. The average milk production per lactation of cows, excluding milk consumed by the calf, was 259.4 + - 25.4 L in 238.8 + - 19.5 days; in carabaos, 125.4 + - 29.7 L in 190.8 + - 24.1 days. The average daily milk production of cows was 1.4 + - 0.0 L and carabaos, 1.1 + - 0.1 L.

The labor requirement in feeding and milking was 91.9 man-days for carabaos and 93.7 man-days for cows, amounting to P735.48 and P749.70, respectively. The profit in cows was P193.73 and P89.11 in carabaos. The average income from milk constituted about 12.3% of the average total income per family. Of the carabaos and cows fed with melengestrol acetate to synchronize heat , 74.4% and 75.0%, respectively came in heat. The conception rate in MGA-heat synchronized animals was 66.7% in cows and 2.2% in carabaos. The female carabaos failed to conceive, probably because these animals failed to ovulate due to hormonal imbalance as an after effect of MGA treatment and/or external stress factors such as heavy work in the farm, high temperature and low level of nutrition. Some practical recommendations were given to improve the management practices, especially the planting of ipil-ipil and forage grasses in a nearby area, forced feeding of ipil-ipil, and loaning a Murrah bull by DTRI to the farmers which will breed the native female carabaos.',NULL,NULL,'De la Rosa, Ma.

All five parasitoids were found to parasitize C. cramella on rambutan, Nephelium lappaceum L. Only Paraphylax sp. was  observed on cacao. Paraphylax sp. was noted in four localities surveyed: two cacao areas (Polonuling, South Cotabato and at USMARC, Kabacan, Cotabato) and two rambutan areas (DES,  Bago-Oshiro, Davao City and at Manongol, Kidapawan, Cotabato). A pteromalid hyperparasitoid of G. mesoxanthus was observed in DES, Bago Oshiro, Davao City. C. cramella and its natural enemies were more abundant in rambutan areas than in cacao. Percent field parasitism of this pest was also higher in rambutan than in cacao.  Eleven hymenopterus parasitoids (nine encyrtids, a eulophid and an inchneumonid), and five predatory species (three coccinellids and two chrysopids) were observed as natural enemies of the cacao mealy bugs. The eulophids were the most abundant while the Cheiloneurus spp. were the most widely-distributed. Mealy bugs and their natural enemies were generally abundant in insecticide-free cacao areas and consequently had high field parasitism. Highest parasitism (91.72%) of mealy bugs was noted in Guma, Digos in Davao del Sur and also had more species of parasitoids.

PDs 461 and 864 broadened the scope of the agency to include research on natural resources, except petroleum. PDs 1249 and 1502 granted PCARR additional authority to conduct agricultural and resources research. The study examined the effectiveness of PCARR in implementing its mandate of programming and allocating funds earmarked for agriculture and resources research. Complementary to the task of technically backstopping the research community, the financial management of the system remained one of PCARR\'s area of concern. The study likewise assessed the level of public investments in research, the allocation of research resources to various agencies and the procedures employed by certain selected institutions in the release and utilization of research funds. A 10% random sample regarding utilization and procedures employed in the release of funds for research projects by the Bureau of Plant Industry, the Forest Research Institute, the Visayas State College of Agriculture, the Philippine Coconut Authority and the PCARR grants-in-aid funds were examined and evaluated. The selected institutions were deemed representative of the various sectors involved in agricultural and resources research. Data were gathered from agency documents and through interviews with the researchers, administrators and PCARR key personnel. The research community generally reacted favorably to the contributions of PCARR in the development of a relevant research system. PCARR started to focus research resources to nation-felt needs as a response to the perennial scarcity of resources in the development of the Philippine economy. With PCARR at the helm, public investments in agricultural research grew at the rate of almost 400%. Still, as a percentage of GNP, current investments was still a low 0.1%, compared to an ideal 0.5% and the average current level of 1% of GNP invested for agricultural research by developed countries. Some ways whereby research investments could be improved were through international sources and through the top-level membership of the Governing Council. As to allocation of research resources to various agencies conducting research, there was no definite pattern followed by the Ministry of the Budget. Inspite of PCARR recommendations on appropriate ceilings per agency since 1978, research appropriations to different agencies continued to be arbitrarily established. The study documented a variety of procedures on releases and degree of utilization of the agencies concerned. The release of funds through the PCARR grants-in-aid mechanism provided for effective utilization, guarantee of documentation and ultimate dissemination to research users. However, releases through the agency mechanism would likewise be effective, as seen in the case of ViSCA, provided there was a commitment and the research orientation and leadership of the institution. PCARR\'s profile and the corresponding strategies in these issues was determined primarily by the following factors: existence of well-defined responsibilities for the different components of the system; the firming up of PCARR\'s credibility with frontline agencies, the regulatory agencies, the policy-making bodies and the international research community; the continued enjoyment of reputation for leadership and dedication to responsibilities by PCARR management and staff and the maturity in commitment and research tradition by the research community.

For cowpea and mungbean, 45 days corresponded to blooming stage and 90 days corresponded to maturity. Stylo and kudzu were still on their vegetative stage at both periods. The results showed that green manuring significantly increased the yield of paddy rice. Plants that received green manure produced an average grain yield of 3.6 t/ha compared to 1.55 t/ha of plants that did not receive any green manure. The four green manure legume species: stylo, mungbean, kudzu and cowpea did not differ significantly on their effects on the agronomic and yield performance of IR 50. Generally, inoculation significantly increased the herbage yield and nitrogen content of the four legume species and greatly increased the growth and yield of rice. Cowpea and mungbean contained greater N at 45 days (2.94 and 2.91% N, respectively) than at 90 days (1.88 and 2.24% N, respectively). Kudzu and stylo on the other hand, had greater N content at 90 days (3.48 and 3.02% N, respectively) than at 45 days (2.84 and 2.47% N, respectively). All the legume crops contributed more N when turned under at 90 days than at 45 days because of greater herbage yield at this stage. The amount of N that each of the four legume crops added to the soil at 45 days was: stylo, 46,22 kg N/ha; cowpea, 59.68 kg N/ha; mungbean, 62.09 kg N/ha and kudzu, 57.43 kg N/ha and at 90 days: stylo, 149.31 kg N/ha; cowpea, 78.53 kg N/ha; mungbean, 97.45 kg N/ha and kudzu, 141.07 kg N/ha.

The mathematical model and system used were sufficiently reliable for practical purposes, giving an objective information, which was far better than subjective guesses made in the past, about the effects of weather on sugarcane yield. The second degree multiple regression equation was used to quantify the relationship between sugarcane yield and meteorological parameters. The results showed that sugarcane reacted differently to climatic parameters during different stages of development. The resultant response was manifested in the final yield. Above average weekly total rainfall had a favorable effect on yield during emergence, but there was a markedly reduced effect during tillering to maturity. Above average maximum temperature depressed yield during the emergence and in the last part of the ripening stage to harvest; however, a markedly favorable effect was observed during the three-fourths to full canopy or during the later part of tillering through elongation stages. Above average minimum temperature had a favorable effect on the growth stages of sugarcane except during the later part of ripening to harvest. Above average weekly total sunshine duration had varying degrees of favorable effects on the growth of sugarcane from emergence to maturity. Beneficial effects of a low magnitude was observed during early emergence and late maturity while maximum favorable effect was observed during the elongation period. This was brought about by the elongation period which coincided with the peak monsoon period whereby cloudiness reduces sunlight - an element very much needed by the crop at this stage; while low magnitude effects of sunshine during early emergence and late maturity might be due to too high sunshine intensities during this period. Above average weekly total solar radiation depressed yield during emergence period while favorable effect was observed for the subsequent stage. The peak beneficial effect was observed during the elongation stage, which coincided with the effect of sunshine duration. Generally, sugarcane was more sensitive to climatic variables used in this study during emergence, elongation and ripening stages. The use of the selected development stages method to predict sugarcane yield gave relatively better results compared to the second degree multiple regression equation model. The reason for this may be attributed to the consideration given to the effect of the interaction among variables. Nevertheless, the multiple correlation coefficients cannot be considered significant because of limited period of data utilized. Its performance was, however, better than the first model in predicting the final yield of sugarcane. The selected development stages method will be very useful in predicting yield of sugarcane with a lead time of about two to three months before harvest.

Mulching had significant negative effect on the survival of Yemane towards 40 days, lower height increment at 80 days, and showed no effect on the other growth parameters. Mulching increased stem K and Fe content. But it was not effective towards the dryer months. Mulching had significantly positive effect on N, K, Ca and Mg stem uptake from 80 to 120 days, but it had a significantly negative effect on Fe stem uptake. Nutrient uptake is interchangeably dependent on either biomass or nutrient content or both. Mulched plots had significantly lower soil Ca at 40 days and soil N, Ca and OM at 80 days. Mulching did not minimize loss of soil moisture but significantly reduced maximum soil temperature at 40 and 80 days. Soil conditioner had significantly negative effect on the survival of Yemane but not beyond 40 days. It had no effect on the other growth parameters. The 20% soil conditioner solution increased stem N content at 80 days but decreased K content at 120 days. The control (0% solution) recorded the highest leaf Ca content, top soil P at 80 days, and subsoil K at 40 days. Lower concentrations favored top soil P and subsoil Ca at 40 days. Interaction of the grass mulch and soil conditioner only increased the stem N uptake but decreased the root P uptake towards 120 days. There was no effect on the survival and growth of Yemane. The survival of mulched Agoho seedlings was significantly lower only at 40 days. Mulching showed no effect on the other growth parameters including survival for the rest of the assessment period. Mulching increased stem P and K content at 80 days but decreased K content at 40 days. It increased stem P and Mg uptake at 80 days but decreased root K uptake at 40 days. Likewise, mulched plots increased top soil K at 80 days only. The rest of the soil parameter values showed no significant difference. Survival and growth performance of Agoho had no response from the soil conditioner application. Biomass nutrient contents were not affected. However, the soil conditioner had significant positive effect on leaf N and stem Ca uptake at 80 days and root P uptake at 120 days. The same treatment had negative effect on leaf P uptake at 40 days. Only the subsoil CEC was positively affected by soil conditioner application. Unmulched seedlings with 10% soil conditioner had positively high stem Mg uptake at 80 days. The expected advantage of mulching outplanted seedlings may not be realized beyond periods that approach a critical soil moisture level, especially when the soil texture is more of sand. In dryer sites of low soil fertility, the added advantage of using a soil conditioner would be difficult to harness, more so if applied at very low concentrations. Results of the study were not conclusive enough to recommend outright application of mulching in Philipine reforestation. Similarly, caution must be taken in making the conclusion that all reforestation species especially in grassland areas may respond to mulching.

A mass balance on solids showed that at 21% (w/v) and 26% (w/v) substrate levels, the residue obtained was 35.8% and 37.3% respectively, of the total solids in the substrate.

More specifically, the study presented a profile of the production-based investment opportunities for Laguna province. It was basically the result of an evaluation process wherein the technical  requirements of various government agricultural priority commodities were compared with the resource endowments of the province. Ecological factors influencing crop growth and development, the more important of which were climate and soils, were emphasized. The whole exercise was done to show the relative suitabilities of various crops in the different municipalities of Laguna so that prospective investors, policy makers and program managers are guided as to the possible production-based agribusiness enterprises they could invest in and/or promote. The study proposed that agricultural development efforts be directed towards commodities of major importance and which have comparative advantage in terms of land and other resources in the province. It must be noted, however, that the recommended production-based investment opportunities should be considered as a first approximation, subject to improvement as more data and information on ecological factors become available.

Majority of the respondents were owner-operators with an average seed farm area of 4 ha, an average seed production of 99 cavans/ha and five years of minimum participation. Most respondents had availed themselves of credit from institutional sources and help from hired labor. The most popular market outlet for seeds were individual buyers, such as the rice farmers and agricultural inputs dealers. The average seed disposal per farmer was 130 cavans/cropping season or an average disposal of 334 cavans/farmer per hectare per season. Three or four visits by the seed inspectors per cropping season were considered adequate. More than one-half considered seed production quite laborious and difficult but rewarding and profitable. Seed growing required more intensive care and attention, especially on postharvest operations such as threshing, drying and cleaning. Certified seeds could command better price than ordinary palay.

Septations were observed 12 hours after, clamp connection initials 24 hours after and the start of radial growth, 48 hours after the start of germination. In water and in water agar (WA) the spores produced oidia on sterigmata. Optimum temperature for spore germination was 30? C.

In addition, other effects of N fertilization and mulching treatments on some soil physical and chemical properties, plant nutrient content and plant uptake were determined four months and six months after planting. N fertilization enhanced the survival of seedlings after six months in the field but the effects were not significant. N was especially important in improving  survival otherwise depressed by the application of mulches such as rice hull, bagasse, banana stalk and sawdust in exposed areas vegetated with cogon. N fertilization at the rate of 1.2 g Urea/plant  doubled biomass production and increased diameter-growth increments of seedlings. Height-growth increments were also enhanced by N treatments but differences were not statistically significant. The high levels of N fertilization significantly decreased soil pH four months after planting but had no effect on soil parameters such as organic matter, available P, CEC and exchangeable K, Ca and Mg. After six months, fertilization did not significantly alter soil pH, organic matter, bulk density, available P, CEC and exchangeable K, Ca and Mg. Soil pH and organic matter were relatively lower and available P slightly higher at six months than after four months. No effects of N fertilization on soil moisture contents were observed except during the first month when soil moisture content was significantly reduced by N fertilization. Increasing levels of N fertilizers significantly decreased N and P contents of leaves but not foliar K, Ca and Mg contents four months after planting. After six months, foliar N, P, K and Ca contents were not affected by N treatments. Only foliar concentrations of Mg at 0.6 g Urea/plant were  significantly lower than those at the 0 and 1.2 g Urea/plant levels. For whole plants, only P concentration decreased with N fertilization. The decreasing trend in N, P and Mg concentrations were attributed to dilution effects caused by increased growth of seedlings in response to N fertilization. Plant uptakes of N, Ca and Mg were significantly increased by the application of 1.2 g Urea/plant. Uptakes of P and K followed the same increasing trend but differences were not significant. The increasing trend in nutrient uptakes reflected the effects of N fertilization in enhancing dry matter yields. The different mulching materials were equally effective in enhancing survival and growth of seedlings when N was applied.

Yield performance during 1973-76 varied from soil to soil but the variation among soil series and among soil types was not statistically significant at five percent except within Magallanes series. During 1973-76, sugar yields were relatively higher than the computed inherent productivities in most soils except for Taal sandy loam and Sibul clay. The computed productivity indices showed that with good management the soils in the DPMD were capable of producing more cane sugar. Insofar as the physical properties are concerned, the criteria adopted in determining productivity indices were useful except in cases of Taal sandy loam and Sibul clay.

The \"t test\" showed significant differences in average yield, current inputs used, labor utilization, and income level between pump-irrigated farms and rainfed farms. Covariance analysis showed that pump irrigation had contributed significantly to the increase in inputs used, labor utilization and, hence, on cost of production. However, the increase in production cost was more than off set by the increase in yield. Labor utilization figures disclosed that majority of the farm operations or activities were done by the rice farmer and his family. Hired laborers were only employed in farm operations, which could not be done wholly by the rice farmer and his family or in farm operations, which should be done at the least possible time; otherwise, losses will be incurred by the farmer. These farm operations were preparing of land, pulling of seedlings, planting or transplanting, and harvesting and threshing. Around 46-53% of the total labor mandays in both pump irrigated and rainfed farms were hire laborers. A Cobb-Douglas production function was used to investigate the productivities of the resources used in the pump-irrigated and rainfed farms. Results showed that pump irrigation systems contributed a positive and significant effect on resource productivity. It caused an upward shift of the intercept term, which implied that there was a higher output per unit of each input with pump irrigation than without irrigation.

The possibility of alleviating plant water stress under these conditions was further explored by observing the water relations, growth and survival of kaatoan bangkal and yemane under three types of antitranspirants:  absciscic  acid,  phenylmercuric aceate, and silicone under 10-4 M, 10-5 M and 10-6 M concentrations. Under conditions of unlimited water supply but high atmospheric stress, kaatoan bangkal and yemane initially transpired at their evapotranspiration potential rate. Transpiration rate eventually declined significantly through time as a result of the decrease in stomatal aperture and the physical effects on evaporation by the constant irradiance applied. A correspondingly low internal diffusion resistance prevented leaf temperature increase. Prolonged atmospheric stress caused stomatal aperture and transpiration reductions, which resulted to wilting of leaves by the 72nd hour. Water balance was, however, maintained. Water stress increased leaf water deficits in the order of -2, -4, -6 bars, respectively. Stomatal aperture and transpiration reduction may have increased the plant\'s abscisic acid levels reducing significantly photosynthesis, harmfully affecting the plant\'s water balance. Both  species experienced leaf abscission, its occurrence noted in -2 bars at 72nd hour, -4 bars at 24th hour and -6 bars at the 4th hour. Antitranspirant applications to water-stressed kaaton bangkal rendered short-term improvements in leaf water content by delaying leaf abscission. Among the antitranspirants, PMA 10-4 M was highest in effecting transpiration reductions in kaatoan bangkal. The addition of ABA leaf sprays caused disruptions in endogenous levels of plant hormone with the plants. PMA directly inhibited photosynthesis through CO2 uptake disruption while silicone coating reduced CO2 permeability to the stomata. Water relations of yemane were insignificantly affected by the antitranspirant type and levels but significantly affected by water stress applied and time. At this point, the use of ABA, PMA and silicone antitranspirants to yemane and kaatoan bangkal was not advisable because of their detrimental effects on photosynthesis, leaf temperature and plant water balance.',NULL,NULL,'Duque, Conrado M.','SOYBEANS, PLANT SOIL RELATIONS, SOIL SORPTION, NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS, PHOSPHORUS, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2523,'2021-09-01 07:44:48','2021-09-01 07:44:48','Evaluation of soil test methods for the analyses of zinc and boron.','1980-09-01','The relative suitability of zinc test methods, namely, 0.1N HCL, 1% aq. disodiumethylenediaminetraacetate (Na2EDTA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and ammonium acetate-diphenylthiocarbazone (Dithizone) were evaluated in greenhouse and laboratory experiments using San Manuel sandy clay loam, Luisiana clay, Alaminos loam and Calumpang clay.

Conventional methods used in time series analysis were employed on the data, especially on trends and seasonalities. Hence, it used least squares in estimating a linear time trend for both current and real prices. Issues on monthly price fluctuations were treated as seasonal indices computed by the method ratio to moving average. At the same time, periodicities in prices by using trigonometric functions were described. Computational procedures allowed for verification of the degree of price variations among market levels, as well as determined associations in price movements between levels. The third part presented a price function postulating that consumer prices were flexible and responsive to such factors which were likely to affect consumer decisions: the amount of chicken meat available to consumers, consumer\'s personal disposable incomes and the general trend in consumer prices. Findings indicated a general rising trend in chicken prices, although native farm prices when expressed in real terms (1972=100) showed a downward behavior. Considering the changes taking place in chicken production, the study anticipated the effect that price trends could bear on the whole chicken industry. Analysis on month to month price variations revealed several things. Firstly, the pattern of behavior for all prices at all market levels were the same during the year. However, seasonalities were more pronounced for broiler\'s wholesale, and for native\'s retail prices. Seasonalities were traced to strong consumer demand during the holidays coupled with the preference of consumers to native chicken meat. There was  amplitude for the consumer prices of broilers. For native chicken, farm level prices were variable. Closeness of price movements between market levels were also determined. Conversions based on cyclical timing relationships suggested that changes in farm prices of native chicken lagged changes being initiated at the retail level. The postulated price function was helpful in determining several issues, concerning consumer decisions and consumer prices. First, the inability of chicken meat supplies to cope with increasing demands causing the upward pressure on consumer prices. Second, there was majority of consumers who belonged to the lower income bracket who served as the restraining factor for enterprising sellers to further raise their prices. Generally, however, chicken prices conformed with the behavior of other prices, such that they followed the pattern of the general price trend.',NULL,NULL,'Espino, Rene Rafael C.','CARICA PAPAYA, GENETICS, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2532,'2021-09-01 07:44:48','2021-09-01 07:44:48','The communication support to the coconut production program in Region III.','1984-09-01','The study tried to answer questions on the extent of communication support to the coconut production program specifically the replanting and intercropping programs, in terms of adequacy, allocation or distribution and utilization.

The data were gathered through interview schedules, questionnaires and from some secondary data analyses. A total of 135 individuals served as respondents.  They were 14 administrators, 44 coconut development officers (CDOs) and 77 coconut farmer cooperators (CFCs) involved in the planting/replanting and intecropping programs of the Philippine Coconut Authority. Findings showed that the administrators and CDOs had congruent perceptions on the adequacy and distribution of human communication resources, i.e., there resources were adequate and proportionately distributed. For the nonhuman communication resources, the administrators perceived they were adequate while the CDOs perceived otherwise. Both CDOs and (CFCs) had maximum use of human communication resources. However, there was significant difference on their perceptions. CFCs perceived greater utilization of human resources than the CDOs. On the  other hand, nonhuman communication resources were perceived utilized on a minimum scale by the same group of respondents. There was no significant difference in their perceptions on the utilization on nonhuman communication resources except for the cassette tape recorder and manuals/pamphlets.

The household as a social unit decided on the cropping patterns and practices employed. The major crop was banana and the secondary crops were fruit trees, plantation crops and rootcrops. The area was suitable for growing trees and deep-rooted crops because the soils were moderately deep, with good drainage. Furthermore, moisture availability was not a constraint. However, the steep slopes of the area and the declining fertility limited the crop production. Land clearing and extractive agriculture including the utilization of forest products, the migrant farmers practiced in NBG disrupted the biophysical, hydrological and chemical equilibria of the soils and the ecosystem as a whole.

Movable shelters were provided to cover the stressed plots in case of rain. Nondestructive area measurement of intact leaves was done to follow enlargement. Photosynthesis was evaluated using an automated system that measured CO2 concentration changes in a closed system. Translocation and distribution of photosynthate were monitored by allowing the plants to assimilate 14CO2 and determining the activity in the different plant components at appropriate time intervals after labeling. Growth was markedly inhibited by inadequate water supply. In view of the small difference between the measured leaf water potentials of the stressed and control plants, however, the decrease in the rate and extent of the stressed plants growth must have been due to factors other than turgor pressure. It was probable that the stressed and control plants may have developed differring responses to turgor pressure and thus, differring growth responses. Generally, the stressed plants exhibited lower photosynthetic rate per unit ground area. Furthermore, a great difference was observed early in the season. The difference in the photosynthetic rates of the stressed and control plants was not attributed to reduced CO2 diffusion due to total stomatal control, because transpiration was slightly higher in the stressed plants. Rather, it could be due to the significant diffference between the total leaf surface area of the plants under the two treatments. Translocation of labeled assimilate out of the leaaves was enhanced by moderate water stress. Significantly greater proportion of 14C was transported to the pods and roots of the stressed plants. This observation was not due to the effect of water stress on the movement of the assimilate into and through the conducting tissue. The higher proportion of 14C going to the roots of stressed plants was considered as a result of higher requirement for energy for growth to enable the plants to absorb any available water and sustain an optimum internal plant water balance. As the plant grew older, a faster rate and a larger amount of accumulation were observed in the pods while the amount remaining in the petioles and stems decreased. This suggested the importance of a higher assimilation rate to cope with the increased translocation during pod-fill as a determinant of soybean yield. The upper 30-cm portion of the soybean canopy assimilated more 14CO2 than did the rest of the plant. The lower rate of assimilation by the lower leaves can be a result of the less radiation the leaves received. This higher rate may have partly attributed to the higher percentage of 14C in the leaves and petioles of the upper part of the plant. The bottom part, however, translocated 14C out of the leaves faster than the upper portion under stress conditions. The different responses of growth, photosynthesis and translocation were reflected in the total dry matter production and the yield components of soybeans. Since the increase in pod weight closely paralleled the increase in total dry matter production in both the stressed and control plants, photosynthesis can be considered as limiting soybean yield more than translocation. Photosynthetic capacity, however, was still determined by the degree by which the photosynthesizing leaves were affected by water stress. Meaning, the size and duration of the green areas necessary for photosynthesis had more to do with soybean yield.',NULL,NULL,'Evangelista, Conrado C.','DURIO ZIBETHINUS, PEST CONTROL, BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY, OECOPHORIDAE, LEPIDOPTERA',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2539,'2021-09-01 07:44:48','2021-09-01 07:44:48','Dynamics of growth and productivity of corn as affected by tillage systems and nitrogen nutrition.','1978-09-01','The effects of different tillage practices (zero, minimum and conventional) and nitrogen levels, (0, 30, 60 and 120 kg/ha) on grain yield, agronomic characters and some physical and chemical properties of the soil were studied.

Based on nematode populations and crop injury indicators, bush sitao, peanut, okra, mustard and pechay were susceptible to R. reniformis. Okra was highly susceptible to M. ingcognita, as evidenced by significant yield reductions, high root gall and root necrosis ratings, high peak populations and population at last harvest. None of the crops were susceptible to the other nematode genera. Population fluctuations were influenced by the initial nematode density and stage of the crop\'s growth. Seemingly, competition for food during the early stage of crop\'s development determined the change of the nematode populations in the succeeding crop stages. Phenamiphos applied at the rate of 10 kg a.i./ha was effective against nematode pests. The effectivity of the nematicide started from the very early stage of the plant\'s growth up to the time when the crops were harvested. This was indicated by the relatively low nematode count in treated subplots throughout the three cropping periods. Multiple regression analyses indicated significant nematode density-yield loss relationship in bush sitao during the second cropping period with the initial and final nematode density as the parameters.

Longevity was at 167.60 days with no significant difference between males and females. Feeding injury by P. iliganus form ugly scars on banana fruit skin rendering it unexportable. Rejected injured fruits reached 19.7% in spite of the usual recommended control measures.

The most prevalent were eorophorid borer, Tonica lagaropis Meyrick and husk borer, Conogethes punctiferalis (Guen.) with infestation ranging from 6.66 to 31.82%. Infestation levels varied with locality, season and clone. T. lagaropis completed its life cycle in 26-37 days while C. punctiferalis in 31-40 days. There were several (two-three) generations in a fruiting season. T. lagaropis larva fed on skin surfaces and internal part of fruit locules leaving reddish frass on the skin. Under serious infestation, the flesh was inedible. On-set of infestation was three to five weeks after fruitset (WAFS). Usually, one to seven larvae were present per fruit. Larva was fully grown in 17-26 days. For C. punctiferalis, larva fed on floral buds, flowers, young and mature fruits. Infestation began on small fruits of marble size (one to two WAFS) and was marked by the presence of massy fecal materials between spines on the fruit. Damage was more external and common on fruits that clump to each other. It seldom fed on flesh or seed. Fruits damaged by Tonica or Conogethes were sometimes exposed to secondary infection by pathogens that lead to fruit rot. The alternate hosts included chico, marang, rambutan, jackfruit and cacao. The population of both species was relatively high from August to September and March to April which coincided with the peak harvest of durian. The natural enemies include a larval-pupal parasite, braconid wasp (Suallonius sp.) and larval predator, earwig (Euborella annulata). Spraying with lamdacyhalothrin or deltamethrin (0.00625 kg ai/ha) from three WAFS for two months significantly reduced borer infestaion from 47.4 to 6.66% and 8.09%, respectively, and increased yield by 6,254.48 and 4,704.70 kg/ha over the untreated control.

While so many IE-related studies have dealt with the technical dimension, this study looked at the social dimension and examined the fabric of how IE becomes woven into the production process of a typical business organization. In particular, this study examined the decision-making dynamics with regard to byproduct exchange (BPX) practice of industrial estate business locators in the Philippines. Specifically, this work probed on the following aspects: 1) policies, 2) decision-making factors, 3) stakeholders\' benefits from BPX, 4) relationships/roles of stakeholders and 5) communication factors. Results showed that for policies and practices related to BPX, certain laws favored the adoption of this concept. In particular, these were the Solid Waste Management and the Clean Air Act. However, IE and BPX practices are not explicitly mentioned under these laws; thus a need for these concepts to be integrated. In looking at the decision-making dynamics, two major factors was found that facilitated or paved the way to the industry adopting BPX. These included: 1) the presence of the Private Participation for Management of the Environment (PRIME) project and 2) the presence of an organizational structure that encourages BPX practice among the primary stakeholders. The organizational structure possessed three features, namely: 1) built-in decision to practice BPX even before company started to operate, 2) local companies connected to partner companies which have high environmental consciousness and because of this involvement, they came to appreciate the merits of BPX as an approach and 3) the presence of Pollution Control Officers Association (PCOA), a substructure in the organizational structure of industrial estate. This structure favored a quicker decision-making dynamics. Since IE and BPX concepts are newly evolving in the Philippine setting, government needs to come up with policies that would encourage the institution of these concepts until they become practices and part of the daily routine of the industries\' production processes. One policy would be on giving incentives to those who make this part of their company life cycle. In addition, either the government or the private sector can build a bridge or a connecting link by providing a group similar to PRIME which can function as a clearinghouse, a database, a networker of companies that are engaged or interested in IE and BPX. Finally, IE and BPX can also be useful to the local government units, particularly in relation to the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000.

Merr.] and kamachile (Pithecellobium dulce (Roxb.) Benth.], grown under nursery condition using Bayombong soil for three months at the UPLB College of Forestry, College, Laguna. The soil was silty clay with 4.5 pH, NPK content of 0.21%, 3.86 ppm, 0.29 me/100 g soil, respectively. Three experiments were conducted. The first focused on the response of the two species to varying phosphorus (P) levels; the second dealt with the species\' response to varying nitrogen (N) levels; and the third involved the response of S. saman to inoculation under different levels of N fertilization and their interaction. The variables that were measured and used in assessing the response of the test host to the different treatments were seedling height; diameter; root, shoot and total biomass; root/shoot ratio; nodule number, ovendry weight; and N content and uptake. S. saman and P. dulce responded favorably to varying levels of P fertilizer. Significant differences were observed in all the growth variables except for root biomass and total biomass. Application of P at 60-90 kg/ha gave the best growth for the two species studied. Independent of P fertilization, kamachile grew three times taller than rain tree and had also higher biomass by 59.93% than the latter. However, rain tree had more effective nodules than kamachile. Rain tree had higher N content and uptake by 48.08% and 14.68% than kamachile. This finding suggested that inoculation might be needed for kamachile if this species could depend on biological N fixation for its N source. It was also suggested that rhizobium for kamachile be screened and utilized in future research in forestry. The two species exhibited varying responses to different levels of N fertilizer. Rain tree fertilized with 200 kg N/ha gave significantly taller seedlings, higher shoot biomass, total biomass and N uptake than those fertilized with lower N levels and the control. On the other hand, kamachile did not yield significant difference in growth parameters, which could be attributed to the application of nitrogenous fertilizer except in N uptake at 75 kg N/ha. Both species, however, needed 25-50 kg N/ha for better nodulation while higher dosage of N i.e., 100-200 kg/ha, inhibited nodulation. Independent of N fertilization, kamachile seedlings increased in height up to 135.52% more than rain tree seedlings. On the other hand, rain tree had bigger diameter and higher root/shoot ratio by 28.45% and 11.08%, respectively, than kamachile. Biomass production of kamachile also improved better by 11.22% in shoot and 8.60% in total biomass than rain tree. Furthermore, nodule production of kamachile was 24.45% higher than that of rain tree. However, in terms of nodule ovendry weight, rain tree had 662.87% increase over kamachile. In addition, there was a remarkable increase in N content and uptake of rain tree as high as 231.12% and 106.85%, respectively. Inoculation with effective Rhizobium strain of rain tree independent of fertilizer levels significantly increased diameter, root biomass, shoot biomass, total biomass, nodule ovendry weight and N uptake. In addition, N application independent of inoculation also gave significant increases in height, diameter, root biomass, shoot biomass and total biomass of rain tree seedlings. The interaction of inoculation and N levels, however, failed to improve the growth parameters significantly except N uptake of rain tree seedlings. Particularly, addition of 75 kg N rate enhanced N uptake by uninoculated plants but inoculation at 25-50 kg N/ha equalled the amount of N taken by the host plant of the same age.

The methodology involved field observations and computer modeling. The computer program written in BASIC language consisted of climate, evapotranspiration, irrigation diversion requirement calculations and turnout adequacy determination. The simulation required inputs such as historical data of climate, secondary or office data and field observation data. The turnout adequacy program determined the adequacy of the system\'s turnout through comparison with the computed required turnout facilities. The computer model developed was tested in the Upper Talavera River Irrigation System (UTRIS). Onion was considered for diversification. The test evaluation showed that at the UTRIS upstream section, the turnouts were inadequate. The rest of the UTRIS sections under study had adequate turnouts. Staggered land soaking and rotational irrigation must be done at sections encountering turnout facility inadequacy as construction of additional ones would be very costly. Irrigation agencies or associations could use the stimulation model in: 1) irrigation planning and programming, as water releases at different areas could be made; 2) deciding on whether or not to pursue crop diversification in their respective systems, as the adequacy of the number of existing turnouts for this purpose could be determined; 3) putting up of new irrigation system, as the information on the turnout facility requirement of the system being envisioned for construction could be  provided; and, 4) providing some avenue to develop a holistic approach in irrigation system management improvement program, as the model could be attached or chained to existing irrigation-related computer programs. There were, however, recognized limitations of the model. The model used very little information on soils, considering that there was an expected shifting from puddled to nonpuddled soil in diversified cropping. Also, the model assumed that there was no shortage of water supply. Finally, the model, did not recognize the capacity of the existing turnouts.',NULL,NULL,'Llana, Ma.

Rosa and Los  Ba?os. It was an attempt to specifically (1) assess the knowledge of the backyard raisers vis-a-vis actual farm practices, (2) determine the raisers\' gain in knowledge a year after the campaign, (3) measure the attitude of the raisers toward the campaign as well as their beliefs and perceived normative pressures, (4) identify the reasons for full, partial and nonadoption of FMD-practices, (5) determine extent of adoption of FMD practices, (6) determine raiser\'s preference for communication strategies/materials employed during the campaign and (7) assess how the preferred strategy helped the raisers in general. The stratified random sampling technique was employed in the study. Since the samples were disproportionate, a weighting technique was used to give the samples a fair share of weight in the analysis. Sixty-one respondents were surveyed in November 1996, using two sets of interview schedules. Data were surveyed using the Statistical Analysis System or SAS. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze characteristics of respondents, knowledge level, preferred communication strategy, reasons for preference, ways by which fora had helped the respondents and perceived normative pressure. Since it has been a year after FMD campaign was launched, knowledge gain among respondents were measured using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. Respondents\' attitudes and beliefs regarding the campaign were determined using a 5-pt Likert Scale. Chi-square analysis was used to determine relationships between sociodemographic characteristics of respondents\' and adoption as well as perceived normative pressure and adoption. On the other hand, the Spearman\'s Correlation Coefficient was used to determine relationship between knowledge and adoption of individual FMD practices of respondents, knowledge and overall adoption of FMD practices, attitude and adoption, beliefs and adoption. Extent of adoption was determined using the adoption index. All estimation procedures were design-based. Results showed that respondents were dominated by males (52.5%). They were mostly middle-aged, falling between 36-45 years old, the youngest being 16 years old and the oldest 75 years old. Educational attainment was high, 42.85% reached college level. Majority of the income derived from backyard animal raising fell within the range of P87,500 to P124,499. Of the sociodemographic characteristics, age and educational attainment were significantly related with adoption of FMD practices. A year after the campaign, most of the respondents had either high or medium knowledge on FMD. An estimated 67% had high knowledge on disposing of sick animals, while afflicted with FMD. On the other hand, 72% had medium knowledge on cause of FMD while only 28% had high knowledge of proper time to vaccinate. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank test showed a significant knowledge gain since the launching of the campaign in 1995, except for the items on proper time/schedule of vaccination and causes of FMD. There was a positive significant relationship on proper time to vaccinate and disposing of FMD-afflicted animals. On the average, respondents generally agreed on most of the statements given, thus, believing in the message of campaign. The more they felt threatened by the disease the greater the likelihood that they took preventive action to avoid FMD. There was a significant relationship between perceived normative pressure and adoption. Analysis of the raisers\' preference for communication strategy/material used during the campaign showed that an estimated 85% preferred the conduct of the forum itself as the mode of information transfer. An estimated 57% felt the forum introduced them to what FMD was and enabled them to increase or add-on to their existing knowledge on FMD. Majority of the respondents were partial adoptors. Although they had high or medium knowledge on most of the recommended FMD practices, most of the recommendations were modified to suit the respondents\' needs. An alarming finding of the study was the lack of social or environment consciousness of the respondents. Most of the respondents simply swept the wastes of animal afflicted with FMD, directly onto canals and into Laguna Lake. Newspaper linings of pigpens were just thrown into garbage cans, thus contributing greatly to the spread of the disease as well as environmental pollution.',NULL,NULL,'Lapade, Bonifacio E.','MANGOES, MANGIFERA INDICA, IRRIGATION METHODS, PLANT WATER RELATIONS, PLANT PHYSIOLOGY, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2018-07-30-03_ab_54855.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(2548,'2021-09-01 07:44:48','2021-09-01 07:44:48','Ilocano terms for Virginia tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) from production to utilization.','1989-09-01','This study was conducted to produce a glossary of Ilocano terms for Virginia tobacco from production to utilization in Region I. Specifically, the author compiled all names, processes and descriptions used for Virginia tobacco in all aspects of production to utilization. This study aimed to provide a ready reference to development communicators and tobacco extension agents for the correct and precise terms to use when disseminating the results of research to the farmers that would be useful in planning communication strategies for tobacco development. This study involved 200 tobacco farmers from 92 barangays of 46 municipalities in the provinces of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, La Union and Abra. The multistage and proportional allocation methods were used to select the sample sites while purposive sampling was used to select the respondents. The average tobacco farmer was 47 years old. The respomndents had an elementary schooling. There were degree holders, however, who were attracted to tobacco farming. Farming was the major source of income of the tobacco farmers but they also engaged in other activities to increase their income. They had stayed in their place of residence since birth. Ilocano was the dialect in their homes. The tobacco farmers had been planting tobacco for an average of 19 years with personal means as their source of knowledge on tobacco farming. They already had changes in their technology especially in the use of fertilizer and insecticides. Their major source of knowledge on tobacco technology were the technicians. Ilocano was the dialect used in information dissemination. The tobacco farmers had problems in understanding the information disseminated because the topics discussed were not clear and not well explained, English terms were used, terms were complicated, and the materials were difficult to understand. A total of 2,037 words on Virginia tobacco production was collected in this study. Harvesting and curing had the most number of words. A total of 431 words had variations and there were 773 variations ranging from 1 to 15 variations per term. Word variability came in different forms like word reversals, letter or syllable substitutions, definition of a word for each term, phonologically similar words and differences in material or implement used for the same process or activity. There were also terms that were area specific and not found in other areas of the region. The loan words were mostly borrowed from English and Spanish. These words retained the sound of the mother language but the spelling had been adapted to the Ilocano dialect.

The PSH treatment consisted of soaking seeds in different osmotica for 12 hours and drying for 48 hours before sowing. Differences were observed among treatments in terms of germination in following order: CaCl2   Control   NaCl   Glucose   distilled water. Concentration effect was clearly manifested among treatments - - that is, 2.5% gave the highest germination in CaCl2, 0.1% in NaCl, and 0.7% in glucose. In terms of vegetative growth, such as number of leaves and height of the plant and finally dry matter yield, calcium chloride with concentration of 2.0 and 2.5% were considered the best. Under field trial the favorable effect of PSH treatment was clearly manifested on the following plant characters: improve fresh weight yield of roots, favorable relative water content of leaves and petiole, which was highest in hardened plants under nonirrigated treatment. Dry weight yield of roots was also higher in the hardened plants than in the control for both the irrigated and nonirrigated plants. These characters were observed during the flowering stage. PSH treatments resulted in higher seed yields than the control regardless of the irrigation treatments.

Study 3 investigated the possibility of conserving the accumulated soil moisture for the dry season crop using resources and techniques right on the farmer\'s field. Of the 222 nonsupervised rainfed farms surveyed in 1982, 26, 63 and 11% were single, double and triple-cropped, respectively. Profits ranged from P2, 190.00 to P2,625.00/ha per year.

In general, the decreasing sequence of toxicity to the three bollworm populations was deltamethrin > endosulfan > malathion > carbaryl. All the bioassay methods were tolerant at College > Gerona > Koronadal population in response to malathion and deltamethrin, and Gerona > College > Koronadal for endosulfan. The topical and dipping methods brought about the College > Koronadal > Gerona population pattern, but the impregnation technique made Gerona more tolerant than the Koronadal population.

The study involved 22 respondents, of whom 13 were representatives/staff of member-agencies, and 9 were farmer cooperators from Lupao, Nueva Ecija. Two sets of questionnaires were used to suit the category of the respondents. Data were analyzed using percentages, mean scores and simple frequency counts. The survey method was complemented with secondary data and participant observation. Interorganizational factors like goals, organizational structure, organizational arrangement, leadership and resources served as inputs to interagency coordination. Likewise, intraorganizational factors like complexity, centralization, formalization and resources also contributed to interagency coordination. The farmer-respondents\' socioeconomic status, organization affiliation, contact with extension workers and attendance in informal gathering were some of the factors that influenced the program implementation. Some of the participants\' problems in the operation of STCP were inadequate funds to support for wider expansion of the program; nonrealization of support services (credit assistance); unavailability of postharvest equipment; delay in the delivery of seeds; and lack of buying/trading centers for soybean produce. Resource exchange/sharing, joint activities/programs, adherence to written agreement, pattern of communication and accomplishment of planned activities were some of the coordination activities. This study proved that interagency coordination (IAC) as a factor, contributed to the development of effective strategies in the delivery of social and agricultural services.

The first experiment was conducted during the dry season (January to May 1995) and wet season (June to October 1995) plantings at farmer\'s fields. The second experiment was done for one cropping (January to April 1996) at the CSSAC Experiment Farm, Pili, Camarines Sur. The leaf area index (LAI), crop biomass and grain yield of corn under LEI were significantly lower than the crop under HEI in the dry season but not in the wet season cropping. Corn yield was 1.9 t/ha in LEI and 2.5 t/ha in HEI in the dry season, and 3.8 t/ha in both inputs in the wet season. In terms of cropping systems, crop yield per plant in single-row pattern was generally higher than those in double row and in pure culture. Peanut LAI, crop biomass, and pod yield were unaffected by inputs in both cropping seasons.  Total pod yield in LEI and HEI were 1.7 and 1.6 t/ha, respectively, in the dry season and 3.7 and 3.3 t/ha, respectively, in the wet season. Monocrop yields were higher than the intercrops in the two cropping seasons. Peanut in 1:1 and 2:2 row patterns had the same yields. The fat and protein contents, viability, vigor and storability of corn seeds were not affected by inputs. Fat content in LEI-derived peanut seeds was significantly higher than HEIs while protein content was unaffected by inputs. The input levels had no effect on the protein content. Seed germinability and vigor were not influenced by input levels but were significantly affected by cropping systems. Seed derived from 1:1 row scheme was unfit for seed purposes because of very low germination (68%) and vigor. Accelerated aging test did not affect the germinability and vigor of corn seeds but substantially lowered the quality of peanut seeds derived from the different production alternatives. The productivity of intercropping corn and peanut was higher than monocropping in terms of land equivalent ratio, carbohydrates and caloric equivalents of crop yields.  The intercrops in 2:2 row pattern were more productive than in 1:1 row scheme. High net returns were obtained when crop yields were valued as seed.

Each field was provided with an artificially inoculated primary focus of 15 plant-hills at center of approximately 6,400 plant-hills. The disease progress pattern indicated a continuous increase during the wet and dry season. The disease progress curve generated by PStV was an S-shaped curve, which was typical of a polycyclic or a compound interest disease. According to Vanderplank\'s equation of average apparent infection rate for compound interest disease, higher rate of infection occurred during the dry season (r=0.36 per unit week-1) than during the wet season (r=0.27 per unit week-1). Likewise, higher levels of final disease incidence was observed during the dry season (6.58- 8.30%) than during the wet season (2.28-4.50%). The higher level of aphid dispersal during the dry season possibly contributed to higher disease incidence and rate of infection. The spread of PStV in space showed a focal pattern indicating a localized spread of the disease from plant-to-plant by nonpersistent aphid vectors. Incidence of PStV decreased with increasing distance of annuli from primary focus. The disease gradient of PStV was steeper in the wet season (-1.65) than in the dry season (-1.29). An account of the estimated multiple linear relationship between disease incidence and environmental factors, indicated that temperature was the most important factor in the spread of PStV in both seasons. Sunshine duration and aphid count were significantly correlated to disease incidence only in the dry season while evaporation and rain were not significantly correlated in both seasons. Aphis craccivora was identified as the principal vector of PStV in the area. The yield and yield components of peanut were not significantly correlated with time of PStV infection. Since the experiment was greatly affected by adverse weather conditions in both seasons, it was possible that the growth and development of the plants were more responsive to factors other than the disease. Hence, the study merits further investigation.

Also, it was inferred that urban- and folk-oriented values would tend to be more associated with high and low level of communication integration, respectively. Sixteen groups of farmers involving 16 contact leaders and 70 follower farmers served as respondents for the study.

On the other hand, the two groups did not significantly differ in terms of income and level of education. Data revealed that there was no significant difference in the type of value orientations held by leaders and followers. This may be attributed to the fact that the two groups did not differ significantly in certain characteristics. However, in terms of level of communication integration within the networks under the contract leader system, leaders were more highly integrated than their members.

A chi-square test of independence was used to test the null hypothesis of no relationship between variables. This research focused on some details of available world wide web-based information services set up by government offices (GO), state colleges and universities (SCU), and nongovernment offices (NGO). These IT-based services are efforts to provide rural people easy access to information. These included Farmers Information and Technology Service (FITS), Mango Information Network (MIN), National Information Network (NIN), International Information System for Agricultural Science and Technology (AGRIS) and Agribusiness Development Center (ADC), which seek to promote cyber extension and fast track modernization of agriculture. Likewise, the study shed light, not only on the nature of the information needs and uses of farmers and extension workers, but also on their behavior and experiences in their exposure to IT-based agricultural extension services. Analysis of the data revealed that elements such as technical support, information and communication technology (ICT) facilities, financial and policy support, which encompass information infrastructure, were positively related to the access and use of IT-based agricultural extension services. In addition, attributes of IT-based information systems and services and users\' characteristics showed significant relationships to the access and use of IT-based agricultural extension activities. These attributes included accessibility, adequacy, compatibility, complexity, responsiveness and timeliness. On the other hand, users\' characteristics involved age, gender, education and their attitudes and perceptions. While the introduction of IT has actually transformed the nature of the whole business of extension delivery, results showed that most of the benefits of IT revolution and cyber extension have not yet accrued in the countryside.

Minimal tillage also helped farmers prepare the land where water would be available without so much delay for land preparation activities. Applying stylo and hog manure during planting following the recommended rate gave comparable root and starch yields with urea. This was due to the timely release of nutrients for plant use, thus, preventing possible loss of released nutrients. This was indicated by the high N, P, and K obtained from the soil and the cassava roots (tubers). Variety Kadabao was a high root- and starch-yielder at eight months. However, for mass production of alcohol where people, machineries and equipment were involved, it would be safer to plant Golden Yellow for it could extend its harvest age with lesser incidence of damaged roots (tubers). There should be an allowance for a delay in harvest age to avoid possible loss in production in case problems arose due to nonfunctional machineries, and misunderstandings between the workers and management. Golden Yellow was also short-statured and therefore was resistant to typhoons. Nutritionally, it contained not only carbohydrates, but also Vitamin A because of its color. The experiments were conducted for only one cropping season. It was therefore recommended that further study be conducted for several cropping seasons under different types of soil to monitor the possible changes in both the soil and the crop. This is needed to determine the possible residual effects of the different sources of fertilizer used and the different tillage-weed control systems employed. There is a need also to study on how to facilitate methods of applying organic fertilizers (i.e. ipil-ipil, stylo, hog manure) to obtain maximum benefits at a lesser cost.',NULL,NULL,'Ligat, Bonnie S.','VEGETABLES, PESTS OF PLANTS, PLUTELLA XYLOSTELLA, POPULATION DYNAMICS, Zoology',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2573,'2021-09-01 07:44:48','2021-09-01 07:44:48','Effects of the different tillage technique on the efficiency of weed control and nitrogen uptake in transplanted rice.','1980-09-01','Two field experiments were conducted at the Central Experiment Station, University of the Philippines Los Ba?os during the wet season of 1977 with the following objectives: (1) to find out the grain yield response of IR-36 to the different tillage techniques; (2) to evaluate the efficiency of chemicals as substitutes for land preparation of transplanted IR-36; and (3) to determine the effect of different levels of nitrogen fertilizer applied at different times on the growth and yield of C168-134. Experiment I compared the six tillage techniques and their effect on the efficiency of weed control, yield and other agronomic characters of IR-36. Results indicated that except for the grain yield, and number of filled grains per panicle, all of the yield components were not significantly affected by the different tillage techniques. The highest mean yield (5122 kg/ha) was obtained from the minimally-tilled plots (dalapon applied 2.5 kg/ha 15 days before transpanting (DBT); dalapon at 2.5 kg/ha after 5 days; paraquat at 0.5 kg/ha after 5 days; followed by one plowing and one harrowing), and the lowest from the no-till plots. The yield reduction was attributed to the large regrowth of Fimbristylis littoralis that were not controlled effectively by the preplant herbicide treatments. The mean yield obtained from the conventional-tilled plots was 5002 kg/ha. Experiment 2 compared three tillage techniques as affected by the time and rate of fertilizer application and their effect on the efficiency of weed control and nitrogen uptake, yield and other agronomic characters of C168-134 rice variety. Statistical analysis showed that tillage techniques and fertilizer treatments significantly affected grain yield. Among the tillage techniques used and the fertilizer treatments applied, minimal and zero tillage plots produced high mean yields (4288 kg/ha and 4069 kg/ha, respectively). The mean yield of the conventionally-tilled plots was only 3825 kg/ha. The increased grain yield in the zero and minimal tillage plots was attributed to the presence of small weeds, hence, less possible yield reduction. Results of the study offered no possible explanation for the yield reduction in the conventional tillage plots, hence, further study along this line was recommended. The results indicated that it was possible to practice minimal tillage as a substitute for conventional tillage depending upon the weed species present, fertility status of the soil, and other production factors which may affect the efficiency of using the different tillage techniques.',NULL,NULL,'Lirio, Lorenza G.','MINE TAILING, REVEGETATION, FERTILIZER APPLICATION, LEUCAENA LEUCOCEPHALA, MAIZE, COTTON, PLANT SOIL RELATIONS, Botany',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2574,'2021-09-01 07:44:48','2021-09-01 07:44:48','Culture of Macrobrachium lanchesteri (de man) in paddy fields with and without rice.','1984-09-01','Production of Macrobrachium lanchesteri (de Man) in 200 sq m paddy fields with and without rice, designated as Treatments II and III, respectively, was evaluated using a stocking density of 200/paddy (100 males and 100 females) or 10,000/ha. Paddies planted with rice, without shrimps, were used as control (Treatment 1). Mean yield of shrimps after 90 culture days in Treatment II of 0.32 kg/paddy or 16.18 kg/ha was higher than that of Treatment III, with 0.27 kg/paddy or 13.38 kg/ha.

The participant observation/case study and interview/discussion methods were used to gather data from 103 respondents. The respondents were purposely selected based on a set of criteria. The respondents consisted of three groups:  kaingineros, schoolteachers and government officials. This study determined the motivations of those who set forests on fire. Specifically, it determined 1) the characteristics of the respondents; 2) the degree and nature of awareness and/or perception and attitude of the respondents to government-promulgated rules and regulations, the role of the local forestry agency\'s staff and personnel in the prevention of forest fires and their perceptions of the general attitude held by the people in Ifugao towards them; 3) the respondents\' beliefs about forest and forest burning behavior; 4) the learning experiences of the respondents that would influence forest burning behavior; 5) the existence and nature of \"revenge\" motivation as a factor in forest burning; and 6) governmental approaches currently employed primarily to solve the problem in the area. The findings showed that notwithstanding socioeconomic characteristics, the belief as to forest ownership was the most vital forestry issue in this study because it explained forest  burning behavior in the area. It contained the unwritten laws describing and defining ways, uses, customs and practices concerning forests in Ifugao. It embraced the realm of kaingin practices and/or the burning-before-planting an area to the staple crop or for purposes other than this. It explained why setting fires upon privately owned forests or upon those believed to be inhabited by supernatural beings such as fairies is considered taboo. In the case of the latter, the \"offender\" usually resorted to native \"baki\" performance for appeasement. Forest burning behavior among the Ifugao may be traced back to deeply-held beliefs, customs and practices, sense of awareness and perceptions as to  the nature of forests in general which influenced and/or interacted with attitudes held toward forest fires, forest burning behavior and other forestry-related matters.

The site was Maramag, Balangkayan, Eastern Samar. One hundred thirty-two respondents were interviewed representing 74% of the families in the barrio, from January 26 to February 22, 1977. Sixty-eight percent of the respondents were wives and 32% were husbands. Their average age was 39.3 years. Most of them were of the child-bearing stage. About 60% had primary and intermediate education, while 10% had no schooling at all. Half of them were farmers and 34% were housewives. Their approximate average income was P1,800.00 per year. Six main variables were investigated. These were: decision-making, authority, influence, sex differentiated tasks, role differentiated tasks and the family life cycle. Results showed the dominance of the joint decision-making pattern, which tended to be wife-alone decision pattern. The authority pattern was dominantly authoritarian with the wife exercising the greater authority, which tended to be democratic decision-making pattern. The influence pattern emanated more from the wife, which was a shared influence pattern. The sex differentiated task role was more male-female-linked pattern tending to be male-linked pattern; and the role differentiated tasks were more specialized on the task of the father, tending to be a shared pattern. Five stages of the family life cycle: the beginning family, child-bearing, child-rearing, child-leaving and empty-fold stages, when related to the family power patterns showed that the wife\'s dominance increased as the family life cycle progressed from the beginning to the child-leaving stages, and then declined at the empty-fold stage, where it ended as a joint pattern.

The four treatments with three replicates each were supplemental feeding with pelleted feeds containing 20% crude protein (Diet 1), 25% crude protein (Diet 2), 30% crude protein (Diet 3) and control with no feeding but fertilization only. The fish (4.10 g average weight) were stocked at a rate of 10,000/ha and grown to harvestable size for 90 days. Fish were fed twice daily, six days a week  at a rate of 5% body weight and adjusted every two weeks. Fish were sampled at four weeks interval. Diet 3 gave the best growth and the highest net production (1,005 kg/ha), followed by Diet 2 with an average net production of 889.4 kg/ha, Diet 1 with 799 kg/ha and the lowest was 342.1 kg/ha for the control (unfed but fertilized). The differences in growth and net production were significant at p 0.05. The highest growth attained by fish fed with Diet 3 indicated that 30% protein level in the diet provided for maximum growth.

However, significant differences were not observed among treatment means (p 0.05). The high survival showed that T. nilotica could tolerate a wide range of salinity variations. The highest number of reproduction (fingerlings) was recovered from fish on Diet 3. Spawning occurred when the salinity dropped to 14 ppt for four consecutive days and no spawning occurred in higher salinities. This result indicated that the higher salinity level might have some adverse effects on spawning.

These were analyzed using SAS and General Linear Model involving simple and multiple correlation and regression, analysis of variance and Duncan\'s Multiple Range Test. Regression curves were tested for best fit for linear, quadratic and log-normal models. Whole data set and by various groupings according to landform, climate, soil texture, drainage class, soil series, soil order, parent material, and cropping system were analyzed. The characteristics of high and low productivity areas were compared. Coconut areas differed widely in productivity. This was attributed largely, to great variations in the growing environment of palms. Yields were higher under type 3 climate in the case of upland areas and lowest under type 2 climate under flatlands. Yields were also higher in alluvial and limestone-derived soils than those in acidic red soils and hydrosols. Yields were markedly lower in areas with only 50 cm thick of soil solum. Cumulative amounts of rainfall before yield estimation was negatively associated with nut yields in the flatlands. The number of rainy days was better related to nut yields in the uplands. In general, the inherent soil properties were positively correlated with yield in greater or lesser degree except in some instances where the effect of one parameter was offset by other soil or external land characteristics. There was a striking antagonism between Mg and X and other cations which was reflected in the yields and explained by imbalance of cations in the soil by correlation analysis among nutrient elements in leaves. Calcium was apparently a dominant element in the soils studied, which contributed to a large extent to pH and base saturation. Cation exchange capacity was primarily determined by clay content. The highest R? values were obtained by the data, which were grouped by landform, climate and texture of topsoil. There were interactions between soil order and climate and between parent material and topography. Analysis of the means of soil properties among the various groupings showed that coastal areas had coarser soil texture than inland farms and had higher fertility level with respect to Ca and Na. Flatlands had higher pH, P and K. Soils under climate 3 were generally more fertile. Poorly drained soils contained higher levels of nutrients than well drained soils, particularly in the upper layer. The most important parameters that exerted the most pronounced effect on the yield were soil series, depth of soil solum, drainage and texture.

It was found that the R-F technology was disseminated through trained government extension workers and through trained farmer leaders who performed the dual role of innovators and purveyors of the technology. A survey of R-F dissemination and utilization activities were collected from previously trained farmer leaders (Group A) and trained government extension workers (Group C) from Regions I to IV. Groups B and D were farmers encouraged by Groups A and C to use R-F technology. Results showed the degree of technology utilization of the farmers was the same, regardless of who the technology delivery channel was. Half of Group A were in the high level of utilization compared to 57.83% of Group B and 45.65% of Group D. Region III exhibited the highest percentage of utilization level at 60.94% and Region II the lowest with 71.70%. Factors significantly associated with the degree of technology utilization were the farmer\'s decision-making pattern in trying innovations; farm characteristics such as total area cultivated, area owned, area suitable for R-F, manner of land preparation and kind of labor used in the farm; availability of resources such as technical assistance, credit, R-F technology coming from FAC-CLSU, and sufficiency of water supply; perceived technology attributes pertaining to economics, inputs availability and relevance to need; and in the case of Group D, frequency of visits of the government extension worker who encouraged the farmer to utilize R-F technology. Cofarmers sought agricultural information from farmer leaders based on their leadership, expertise and friendship. The continuing relationship between the farmer and the farmer leader who was the knowledge linker was the mechanism for effecting the technology transfer. Problems in R-F culture were mostly resources-related with lack of fingerlings topping the list. Some deviations from the Research Center\'s recommendations occurred in the technology transfer. Groups A and C did not differ in their retention and thereby  transfer of R-F principles.

Two levels of CMAE (5% and 17%) and four kinds of gonadotrophins (without gonadotrophin, with FSH, with LH and with FSH-LH combination) constituted the eight treatments (2 x 4) using a total of 48 cockerels representing two age groups. Twenty-four one-month-old cockerels represented the age to receive the various treatments before full reproductive functions were fully developed, and 24 eight-month-old cockerels represented the age to receive the various treatments after reproductive functions were fully developed. The birds were randomly distributed to the different treatments with three birds per treatment and each bird representing a replicate. Results revealed that feed intake of both age groups was lowered when 17% CMAE was mixed with the diet. The lower feed intake resulted in a significantly lower weight gains. Regardless of the level of  CMAE, administration of LH alone or in combination with FSH resulted in higher liveweight gains of both the one-month- and the eight-month-old cockerels. The weights of the liver, kidney, spleen and heart of both age groups of cockerels were not affected by CMAE level as well as the exogenous gonadotrophins. The testes weight of the one-month-old cockerels did not differ regardless of CMAE level in the diet and exogenous gonadotrophin administration. However, with the eight-month-old cockerels, there was a dramatic increase in weight of the testes as a result of the FSH-LH treatment, although testes weight was not affected with CMAE level in the diet, regardless of gonadotrophin administration. CMAE caused a decrease in the lymphocyte and an increase in neutrophil values of the eight-month-old birds. LH administration decreased the neutrophil count and increased the lymphocyte value of the one-month-old cockerels. It also increased the RBC and hemoglobin values of the eight-month-old cockerels. Of the various parameters used in evaluating the physiological responses of cockerels to mimosine with or without gonadotrophins, the histological examination of the testes was the most sensitive criterion. While the testes appeared normal in looks, size and weight, the histological findings showed some degeneration of the seminiferous tubules of the birds, which received 17% CMAE.

The effects of seven chemicals on the germination of Benguet pine seeds were studied. Repellant activities of those chemicals at concentrations which had not affected germination adversely or those that reduced it by not more than 15% were evaluated on caged Rattus rattus mindanensis and R. argentiventer. The liquid formulation of endrin at one and two percent active ingredient greatly reduced and delayed germination. Germination value, a term combining speed and completeness of germination, was significantly reduced at 7.5 and 3.35% thiram treatments and slightly reduced at 2.0 and 1.0 aldrin treatments, respectively. DDT and latex did not affect germination. Dieldrin and vetox were toxic to the seeds; reduction in germination was directly related to chemical dosage. Preliminary feeding tests showed that thiram, aldrin and dieldrin reduced seed consumption by 80% or more. The Rhothane formulation of DDT was moderately effective, while DDT and vetox were only slightly effective. Species of rodents and animal weights did not influence seed consumption. In the second test series, 7.5% thiram and 2.0% aldrin reduced seed consumption by 77 and 78%, respectively, in the first treatment day; seed consumption on succeeding days was negligible.

Data were gathered by means of personal interviews with 158 rubber smallholders scattered in the municipalities of Makilala, Kidapawan, Magpet, President Roxas, Matalam and Kabacan in North Cotabato. The study showed that the rubber smallholders had an average of 50.94 years; the average level of education was second year high school; the average household size was 6.27 members; and they were engaged in rubber planting for the last ten years. Majority owned not more than 7 ha of rubber plantation and derived income from it on the average of P15,000.00/year. About two-thirds of the respondents used their personal savings in establishing their rubber plantations. Most of them depended on their fellow rubber planters for information pertaining to production. Only five out of 12 recommended rubber production practices were adopted by more than 50% of the rubber smallholders. These practices were: ring-weeding, standard tapping system, use of high yielding clones, use of cover crop and uniform height of opening. Most frequently mentioned problems included price fluctuation, diseases, typhoon and arbitrary measurement used by the buyers to determine the dry rubber contents of rubber products sold by the smallholders. In terms of relationships, educational attainment was significantly related to five out of eight recommended rubber production practices; household size to two out of eight; farming experience to six out of eight; gross income from rubber to only one out of eight; income from other sources to three out of eight; gross income from all sources to three out of eight; sources of finance to six out of eight; size of plantation to four out of eight; number of sources of information to only one out of eight; and marketing tie-up to four out of eight recommended rubber production practices.',NULL,NULL,'Serrano, Rogelio C.','AGROECOSYSTEMS, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2587,'2021-09-01 07:44:48','2021-09-01 07:44:48','Response of white potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) to moisture stress.','1996-09-01','The effects of moisture stress on the growth and yield of potato were studied at the Mountain State Agricultural College Experiment Station from November 1978 to June 1979 and at the University of the Philippines Los Ba?os College of Agriculture on December 1979.

Likewise, height differed among the potato varieties. On the other hand, dry matter production and root-shoot ratio were not affected by moisture stress. However, \'Red Pontiac\', \'Cosima\', \'Fina\' and \'Siro\' had significantly higher root-shoot ratios than \'Alpha\'. Soil moisture and relative water contents likewise decreased with moisture stress at any growth stage. \'Red Pontiac\' was able to maintain higher relative water content than other varieties. On the other hand, there was a general decrease in stomatal aperture and an increase in stomatal resistance when potato plants were water-stressed. However, no significant difference was noted among the potato varieties. Free proline accumulated in all the growth stages of the potato plant as a consequence of moisture stress. \'Red Pontiac\' and \'Cosima\' accumulated more free proline during stress than the other varieties but the former recovered much faster than the latter. Moreover, water stress significantly reduced the total yield when applied in all growth stages. Higher yields were obtained from \'Red Pontiac\' and \'Cosima\'.

Chromium concentrations in the stems and leaves of water hyacinth varied from 673 to 3350 ppb in dried samples and 114 to 467 ppb as estimated for the wet weight of the plant. Aqueous concentrations ranged from 1 to 13 ppb. Seasonal variation in aqueous and plant tissue concentrations of chromium was significant but spatial differences were slight. The accumulation potential of water hyacinth expressed as enrichment factors or ratio between plant and aqueous concentrations varied from 118 to 848 for oven-dried plants and from 20 to 144 for fresh plants. The observed enrichment factors were sufficiently high to raise chromium concentrations to levels detectable by common atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Plant tissue concentrations, however, were slightly correlated with aqueous concentrations for both arithmetic (r=0.59737, P< 0.05) and logarithmic values (r=0.62158 P<0.05) of the two variables. Using estimates of the natural variability, measurement errors and data collection costs, alternative sampling designs for monitoring of chromium using water and water hyacinth as indicators were examined. The sampling design of existing water quality monitoring programs in Laguna de Bay were applicable for trend monitoring of chromium levels. Optimization suggested that monitoring of chromium levels in Laguna de Bay using water hyacinth may be equally cost effective. Plant tissue concentrations of chromium may be used as surrogate variables for aqueous values once a predictive relationship between the two variables was established.

Cross-section data from 20 sugarcane farms during CY 1984/85 showed no significant difference in the yield per hectare between the mechanized (MP) and nonmechanized parcel (NMP) groups. There was a difference in the structural form of production functions derived from MP and NMP groups in the Chow\'s test. Decomposition analysis, showed the difference was reflected by the higher intercept of the production function of MP groups (3.4888) than the intercept of the production function of NMP group (3.0395). Further test using covariance analysis showed significant positive regression estimates for mechanization dummies. The last three tests reinforced each other findings indicating that mechanization might enhance output growth. Cost and return analyses showed that the per unit cost of producing a picul of sugar was lower in MP, hence, net farm income was higher than the NMP group. Factor share analysis showed that mechanization affected income distribution. As farms became mechanized the share of skilled labor became higher. Conversely, the share of unskilled labor which comprised bigger percentage of the sugarcane work force decreased. There was displacement of labor as a result of mechanization. Reduction in total labor utilization ranged from 37% to 67% when machines were used in planting, weeding, fertilizing and postharvest operations. Responses from sugarcane workers showed that their yearly utilization of farm-hand decreased as a result of mechanization. In general, however, their total labor increased because of increased labor for off-farm and nonfarm activities. The increase in off-farm labor was brought about by the diversification projects implemented by the farms/hacienda where they worked.

The study focused on ten agricultural research projects implemented by an academic institution, two foundations, a government agency, and a nongovernment organization. These projects cover such research sectors as livestock, farming systems, crops and socioeconomics. Ten research leaders of the purposively chosen organizations and projects served as key respondents. Nine others (technical and administrative staff, chief accountant and research director) were interviewed to get further information and to clarify or validate information from the key respondents. Secondary materials such as project documents, policies, rules and regulations and processes were analyzed and used as references to cross-verify interviews. Findings indicated that the research projects, regardless of their sector, were facilitated by some factors such as knowledgeable research and administrative personnel, supportive management and staff, few decision channels, good leadership of project leaders, responsive and flexible administrative and financial management systems, sufficient or wider discretionary authority in handling of projects, and adequate funds among others. On the other hand, some projects were susceptible to constraints. The nature of the project, size of budget, and source of funds did not influence the occurrence or nonoccurrence of contraints. These constraints included among others, insufficient cash advance, numerous decision channels, rigid accounting and auditing rules that were not responsive to field conditions, delay in receipt of research funds, and nonappreciation of research work by administrative staff. These constraints slowed down and/or hampered research work rather than promoted it. Research leaders identified the different factors, which they considered promoters of or impediments to their managerial creativity and administrative vitality, and those they considered an encouraging environment for research. This study hoped to contribute a better understanding of R&D management to the theory of public administration. To some extent, based on this study, R&D management was just like general management and might be based on theories from it. R&D management and general management both dealt with people, activities, processes, systems, rules and regulations, and controls among others. R&D management needs, however, were distinct from those of regular government operations. R&D management needs an environment that encourages and enhances a researcher\'s creativity and freedom to undertake R&D activities and facilitate the attainment of project objectives and the production of R&D results. Also, in R&D management, facilitative and constraining factors positively and/or negatively affected operations. The difference was that in R&D management, there were more people (researchers) who were impatient with routines and sometimes, even with time. They exercised their creativity and commitment to the project not only in the technical aspect of their work but also in its administrative aspect. Thus, they developed coping mechanisms to deal with constraints and brave consequences for deviating from rules, regulations, and usual procedures. Their main concern and interest were the attainment of project objectives and production of research results more than anything else. Whatever similarities and differences R&D management shared with general management, it is important that we understand and learn from the experiences in R&D management and adopt those that would improve our existing administrative and financial management systems. To mention a few, it is worthwhile for government agencies to assess their structures and consider decreasing decision channels to facilitate decision making.

Of the 36 t of fish recorded during the seven-month sampling period, 20 t or 55% were yellowfin, Thunnus albacares and 3.3 t or 9% were skipjack, Katsuwonus pelamis. Yellowfin were grouped into three size classes: small fish measuring 30-45 cm (FL (86.7%); medium-sized fish, 45-70 cm FL (4.2%); and large fish, 90-160 cm FL (8.6%). The size of the skipjack tuna ranged from 22-64 cm FL.  Morphometric relationships of characters used including head length, eye diameter  and body length) against fork length were linear in all cases.  The length-weight conversion value obtained for skipjack yellowfin tuna was W = 2.545 x 10-5  L 3. For skipjack tuna, it was W = 5.588 x 10-5  L 2.696.

Transparency was the best in Dallao (1.5m) indicating food growth of zooplankton and phytoplankton. Both water levels had pH values with a short range variation of 1-1.1. The pH values (6.5-8.2) were within the desirable levels (6.5-9.0) for fish production. Total alkalinity and total hardness were both highest in Dallao with values of 34.83 mg/l and 100.92 mg/l, respectively. This indicated that the area had greater production of plankton suitable for fish production. In terms of the biological productivity, it was observed that gross photosynthesis concentration ranged from 3.40 to 4.87 mg/l of DO. This indicated active photosynthesis processes within 2 m from the surface of the water level. Phytoplankton and zooplankton densities varied by station and by month. Dallao contained higher densities of the phytoplankton (300.5/ml of water sample) and zooplankton (377.01/ml of water sample) than the other stations. Phytoplankton and zooplankton densities in all sampling months were significantly high, except for December. This was attributed to low temperature readings in this month which hindered photosynthetic activities.

Among the four crops grown, the grain yield of corn was significantly affected by the preplant treatments in chromolaena-infested field. C. odorata as mulch in cassava plants produced the tallest plants and had the heaviest dry stubble. The frequency of occurrence of noxious and toxic weed species was reduced in sweet potato.

The most common and predominating weed species regardless of crops grown were C. odorata, Ageratum conyzoides, Lindernia crustacea, Cyperus iria and Fimbristylis dichotoma. C. odorata and A. conyzoides were persistent in varying number of population. The preplant treatments affected the shift in weed species and weed composition.

The vegetative characters were the most efficient predictors discriminating the different populations at 1% level of significance conforming to the a priori classification of the different populations used in the study. The result could provide a headway in coconut conservation work where biochemical analysis failed to accomplish in the past attempts to classify coconut populations. On the other hand, the nut components as predictor variables, in many instances could not identify differences between distinct populations. The stepwise discriminant analysis selected seven out of nine vegetative characters with number of leaf scar per meter, considered the strongest predictor contributing 86% in the discrimination of the total variability followed by the second orthogonal variable, bole girth, contributing 38%. The split nut weight was the most discriminating character among the six nut components accounting for 56% of the total variability. The generalized distances between populations although based on morphological characteristics may have some genetic implications as there was a consistent trend to support the apparent stability of the distances between paired populations highlighted on two occasions, 1) a high correspondence between generalized distances and phenotypic differences of paired populations and 2) high correspondence between generalized distance and proximity of geographic origins between paired populations. More consistent clustering of the dwarf, tall and the dwarf x tall populations were obtained when using vegetative characters as predictors registering 96-99% adequacy of clustering with only the dwarf x dwarf and tall x tall populations misclassified as dwarf and tall, respectively.

The different nonprotein nitrogen (NPN) sources [urea, (NH4)2SO4 and (NH4)3 PO4] were added to each treatment to raise the CP content of the diet to 22%. Each dietary treatment was replicated three times with 15 birds per replication, contained 22% CP and 2800 kcal ME/kg of feed. The tenth treatment was a commercial broiler ration (check diet). No mortality of the birds was attributed to NPN sources even at high level of supplementation. Low levels of NPN in the diet had higher feed consumption, higher body weight and better feed efficiency than high levels of NPN. NPN sources, particularly urea can replace part of the total protein requirement of broilers, however, the e.a.a. level must be maintained at level no less than 70% of the requirement. Optimum performance was attained at all levels of urea (0.83-2.08%) and 1.5% (NH4)2SO4 and 2.00% (NH4)3PO4. Marked decrease in performance was observed at high levels of ammonium compounds particularly, (NH4)3PO4 which may be attributed to decreased palatability.

After growing and screening in pasteurized nipa sap, ten high acid-yielding isolates were selected and further screened in cassava medium. The growth of the bacteria in pasteurized palm sap was characterized by an abrupt increase.  Maximum amount of acid was observed during the sixth day of fermentation. In cassava medium, there was a gradual increase in the amount of acetic acid up to the 14th day. The ten isolates were identified as Acetobacter aceti subsp. aceti, A. paradoxus subsp. paradoxus, six subspecies of A. ascendens, A lovaniensis subsp. lovaniensis and A. rancens subsp. pasteurianus. A. aceti subsp. aceti produced consistently high amounts of acetic acid in pasteurized nipa sap while in cassava medium, its amount was lower than those produced by A. lovaniensis subsp. lovaniensis. Further screening of the bacteria was done using standard medium. The concentration of inoculum (10, 20 and 30%) and alcohol (4, 7 and 10%) and incubation temperature (20, 30 and 35?C) were varied to determine the optimum conditions for their growth and acetic acid production. Different temperatures, in varying levels in inocula and alcohol produced different amount of acid. Optimum amount of acetic acid was produced at 30?C, 20% inoculum and 4% alcohol in the medium. However, A. aceti subsp. aceti and A. rancens subsp. pasteurianus were able to produce high amounts of acid at seven percent alcohol.

Diploid and triploid C. esculenta had chromosome numbers 28 and 42, respectively. A. macrorrhiza, C. chamissonis and A. campanulatus had 2n=28 while X. sagittifolium had 2n=26. Fourteen was suggested as the original basic number from which X=13 in one species may have been derived by aneuploid loss of a pair of chromosomes. Further, X=14 was presumed as derived from lower X=7 by doubling. Details of the karyotype of each species were worked out and different types were observed. There were different evolutionary lines operating in these aroids. Further, karyotypes among these aroids also showed differences in absolute chromosome size indicating changes in nuclear DNA in evolution. Reduction in chromosome size appeared as an adaptation to an aquatic habitat in two species of aroids. Meiotic studies were made only from C. esculenta and A. macrorhiza. Meiotic behavior in these two species were highly irregular. Desynapsis in diploid taro was detected in the course of the cytological study. Its meiotic behavior conformed to the complete type of desynaptics. Two peculiar types of meiotic behavior were detected in two clones of triploid taro. The first showed multiple sporocytes. The other cultivar was either asynaptic or desynaptic. Classification of this material in either of the above category was handicapped due to the absence of pachytene stage. A. macrorrhiza was also desynaptic which was classified into moderately strong class. The probable causes of these abnormalities were discussed. Morphological variability in terms of plant size, leaf and petiole dimensions, growth habit, leaf arrangement, lamina orientation, leaf margin, leaf margin color, leaf color, leaf surface, vein and petiole color, leaf sheath pattern, corm shape, corm flesh and cortex color, corm exterior skin and the degree of fibrousness of corm was observed in various accessions/varieties of the five species of aroids.

The possible influence of some pretreatments on plant responses to moisture stress was also studied. Germination and seedling emergence were maximum in the soil media (Lipa clay loam) with an initial moisture content of 30.00%, which was almost the same as the field capacity of the soil (32.67%). The soil with an initial moisture content of 20.00% germination was considerably reduced. The moisture content of this soil, which had dropped to about 14.18% after four days, was also too low to allow seedling emergence since this moisture level was already near the moisture level at permanent wilting point (11.00%). Although germination of UPLCP2 was relatively less sensitive to low osmotic potential, its seedling emergence was lowest in soil media with an initial moisture level of 25.36%. Seedling emergence was higher in UPLCP5 and BPICP2  at this moisture level. In pot experiment, moisture stress imposed ten days after emergence until the peak vegetative stage caused considerable reduction in plant height, number of leaves, leaf area, shoot and root dry matter yield, chlorophyll content, pod yield and its components. Moisture stress increased stomatal resistance, leaf water potential and root to shoot ratio. Cowpea was quite resistant to moisture stress. The internal stress exhibited by the plant was just mild as indicated by the stress rating and leaf water potential in spite of the level of external stress caused by low soil moisture content. From an initial soil moisture content of 35%, it dropped to about 13% at the end of the stress treatment. Drought resistance was one of avoidance. The major mechanism was the reduction in total leaf area and the overall suspension of growth. Other contributing features included increased stomatal resistance and root to shoot ratio and the change in leaf orientation with respect to the incident radiation. Under simulated moisture stress condition, plants exhibited a more severe physiological stress. UPLCP2  succumbed to the treatment while  BPICP2 and UPLCP5 survived. Also, under this condition, the leaf free-proline content of BPICP2 and UPLCP5 was considerably increased. Thus, BPICP2 and UPLCP5 were more resistant varieties as they were more superior in terms of the aforementioned adaptive mechanisms and survived under the simulated moisture stress condition. Under drought condition the absolute yield of UPLCP2 was highest, however, yield reduction over that of the control was greatest. Seed pretreatments only caused a slight advance in seed germination but did not affect subsequent seedling emergence and establishment or caused any modification in the plant morphological and physiological responses to moisture stress.',NULL,NULL,'Ladja, Hamjaraja B.','FISH PONDS, RECLAIMED SOILS, PRODUCTIVITY, FERTILIZER APPLICATION, Fisheries',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2621,'2021-09-01 07:44:49','2021-09-01 07:44:49','A study of service agencies and farmer development in Bicol Integrated Area Development II - A.','1988-09-01','This study was conducted at the Bicol Integrated Area Development II-A project in San Ramon, Bula, Camarines Sur.

The data were gathered from 21 technicians and 130 farmers. The structure of management, coordination, the approaches and strategies adopted by the technicians before and after BIAD II-A project implementation were analyzed. The \"before\" and \"after\" research design was used to determine the contribution of Bicol IAD II-A project to the development of farmers from 1974 to July 1978. Findings showed that the BIAD II-A project provided an effective mechanism for the integration and coordination of interagency participation because of the Composite Project Management Office, a policy making body composed of regional directors of participating agencies and provincial governors. The technicians claimed that individual and institutional approaches, farm and home visits, method and result demonstrations, conferences, seminars, workshops and training programs were most commonly adopted to attain their respective roles in the project. The individual approach also provided technicians the opportunity to gain more insights on the actual problems and needs of farmers. The Bicol IAD-II project already contributed significantly to the economic development of farmers. This was reflected in high percentage shift from tenant farmers to lessee and owner-operator status; increase in size of irrigated farms; increase in available capital per farmer by P158; increase in average value of family assets by P1,970; increase in average production of rice from 57.91 cavans to 68.95 cavans/ha. The average annual income per family increased from P5,635.62 to P7,633.86. Significant contributions to the educational development of farmers were illustrated in changes in: aspirations of farmers; their attitude towards development, innovations, technicians, community activities and barrio associations. There was also a highly significant change in the degree of adopting high yielding technologies in crop production and improved home management practices. The most significant influences of BIAD II on the social life of farmers were:  the low annual rate of five percent out migration; the strong relationship of people in the community; the high degree of participation in barrio activities; and the high membership in barrio organizations.',NULL,NULL,'Lanting, Elaine L.F.','COWS, LACTATION, ANIMAL FEEDING, FISH MEAL, COPRA MEAL, RICE STRAW, UREA, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2622,'2021-09-01 07:44:49','2021-09-01 07:44:49','Factors associated with dietary intake of pregnant women in Llorente, Eastern Samar.','1978-09-01','The study evaluated the dietary intake of pregnant women and determined the factors that affect it.

Results showed that the drying air temperature and airflow rate significantly influenced (p<0.01) the grain\'s drying time, fissuring/cracking and hardness. Increasing the drying air temperature and the airflow rate reduced the actual drying time, total time of drying operation and hardness value of rough rice.

Annual burning of one of the grassland catchments was stopped in 1977 before it was reforested with G. arborea in 1980. Secondary hydrologic data from 1975 to 1982 of each catchment were used. The annually burned and reforested grassland catchments had similar slope (20-30%). They had clay soil and argillic horizon. The surface soil of the annually burned grassland had lower proportion of the water stable aggregates larger than 0.5 mm (58%) than the reforested grassland (67%). The surface soil of the reforested grassland catchment had higher base saturation and exchangeable calcium than the annually burned grassland catchment. The secondary dipterocarp forest catchment had steeper slope (36-64%), low stream and drainage density and clay loam soil with 47% water stable aggregates larger than 0.5 mm. Its surface soil had very low base saturation and cation exchange capacity. The mean annual runoff and runoff coefficient were generally higher in the reforested grassland than in the annually burned grassland catchment because the former has higher drainage density. The secondary dipterocarp forest catchment had the lowest annual runoff and runoff coefficient due to its low drainage density and better vegetative cover. Surface runoff was significantly correlated with rainfall amount and rainfall duration. There was high sediment concentration at the first two months after the onset of the rainy season in the annually burned grassland catchment. Improvement of the vegetation cover by stopping annual burning and subsequent reforestation of the other grassland catchment markedly reduced sediment concentration. On the third year after the annual burning was stopped, the sediment concentration of the reforested grassland was lower than that of the secondary dipterocarp forest catchment. The high surface runoff of the reforested grassland catchment contributed to its high sediment yield inspite of low sediment concentration. Its mean annual sediment yield three years after reforestation was lower than that of the secondary dipterocarp forest catchment.

Results on the comparison of a 22 ppm P treatment based on field experiment with rates ranging from 40 to 1270 ppm P estimated from the  sorption isotherm showed that all the soils were responsive to phosphorus fertilization.

Salinity did not effect the levels of hormone which induces sex reversal. There was no significant (P>0.05) interaction between salinity and hormone levels on fish survival, growth and sex reversal. Methyltestosterone at 30-45 ppm produced 100% male tilapia.

The lowest spore count was under alternating cycles of 12-hour near ultraviolet (NUV) light and 12-hour darkness using a 40-watt Philips black lamp. Incubating seeds in agar and blotter tests under continuous ADL was better than complete darkness as darkness caused browning of uninfected seedlings making evaluation of infection difficult. The highest seed infestation and infection of 27% by F. moniliforme was on blotter test without pretreatment, while agar test with pretreatment using 1% sodium hypochlorite showed 18% infection. Seed washing the rice seeds harbored F. moniliforme spores externally. Typical bakanae symptoms were produced at the shortest period when germinated seeds were grown in soil infested with rice grain inoculum. High inoculum levels from 30 to 50% caused stunting, blighting and death of inoculated plants; while lower inoculum levels from 1 to 20% caused elongation. Seeds germinated in cell-free culture filtrate of F. moniliforme resulted in elongated seedlings at lower filtrate concentrations whereas concentrated filtrate produced stunted and chlorotic seedlings. Hot water treatment of naturally infected seed at 60?C for 15 minutes reduced germination to 9% but failed to completely eradicate F. moniliforme.

Respondents in the study were 214 graduates of 12 state agricultural colleges. These were selected based on their being graduates of the respondent-institutions and took the knowledge level test administered by the Technical Panel for Agricultural Education (TPAE) in March 1983. Some of the data were retrieved from the TPAE Data Bank while others were gathered by means of semistructured questionnaires. Percentages, means, frequency counts, standard deviation, Student t-test, Chi-square test, correlation and stepwise regression were used for the analyses of the data. About 50.94% of the respondents were \"high achievers.\" The percentage of graduates with \"high knowledge level\" was higher in SCUs with 58.06% than in the MECS colleges with only 40.00%. The knowledge level of graduates from the SCUs was significantly higher than those from the MECS colleges. The independent variables which significantly differed between the two types of schools were: education of respondents\' mothers, civil service eligibility status of teachers, faculty-student ratio and library facilities under the student-teacher- and physical resource- related factors. Of the government costs, except for equipment outlay which differed at 0.05 level of significance, all cost items differed very significantly (0.01 level or higher) between SCUs and MECS colleges.

Root K concentration significantly increased while crown K concentration significantly decreased with the application of N. Stem, fruit, leaf and slip K concentrations were not significantly affected. Potassium uptake of all the organs significantly increased except crown K uptake which significantly decreased with incremental N. In general, the influence of N was to decrease P, Ca and Mg concentrations of the different organs with marked effect on stem, fruit, leaf, crown and slip P concentrations; crown and slip Ca concentration and stem, leaf, crown and slip Mg concentrations. Root Ca concentration, however, significantly increased at high N level. Application of N significantly increased root, stem and fruit P uptake; root, stem, fruit, leaf and slip Ca uptake and root and leaf Mg uptake but significantly decreased leaf and crown P uptake, crown Ca uptake and crown Mg uptake. Application of 10 g N/plant significantly increased fruit and leaf Mg uptake but tended to decrease at high N level. Incremental K did not significantly affect N and K concentrations of the different organs. Application of K significantly increased stem P concentration and root Mg concentration but significantly decreased fruit and leaf P concentrations; fruit Ca concentration and stem Mg concentrations. Others were not significantly affected. Root, stem and leaf P uptake and root and slip Ca uptake significantly increased while fruit and crown P uptake and stem and leaf Ca uptake significantly decreased with the application of K. High K level significantly increased root, stem, leaf and crown Mg uptake. No other significant results were noted. The nitrogen concentration in the different organs ranged from 0.26% in the root to 1.07% in the leaves.

The antitranspirants used were spruce seal, atrazine, phenyl mercuric acetate (PMA) and corn oil at varying concentrations. The study consisted of two experiments. Experiment I consisted of storing the seedlings in the laboratory and Experiment II was a field trial performed at the Experiment Station, Plantation Crops Division, Department of Horticulture. Spruce seal and corn oil effectively conserved the original relative water content (RWC) at five days storage compared to atrazine and PMA. After 15 days of storage, 1.5% spruce seal, 20 ppm atrazine, 10_3 M PMA and 2.0% corn oil were the ones effective in conserving the original RWC, which also resulted in better retention of leaves. The original RWC on the transplanted uprooted coffee seedlings was better conserved with 2.0% spruce seal, 20 ppm atrazine, 10-5 M PMA and 2.0% corn oil. Uprooted seedlings treated or untreated with antitranspirants had 25-40% mortality rate. There was no mortality in the control. The number of leaves was significantly affected by uprooting rather than the use of antitranspirants. The width and length of leaves in the transplanted uprooted seedlings were insignificantly different from the antitranspirant-treated plants.

The problem soil, which was taken from the field without disturbing the soil profile, was in drums. The drums with soil were arranged according to a split-plot in completely randomized design. Three methods of water application were randomized among the main plots while the four depths of drainage were randomized among the subplots. The effects of the 12 treatments on the trafficability of problem soils was principally determined from the measurement of cone indeces. Based on the cone index (soil strength) meassurement, the problem soil increased its strength to an average of 257.8 psi when no water was applied for three weeks. When water was applied intermitently, the increase in strength under saturated condition was at least 35.4 psi while the increase of soil strength under continuous water application only ranged between 3.3 and 5.6 psi. The differences in strength among drainage depths of 12, 18, 24 and 36 in were not significant at five percent level. This was attributed to the effect of dessication and inefficient provision for drainage. However, the effect of drainage was observed in the measurement of water table. Soil strength increased as the water table moved down from the soil surface. The coefficient of correlation was 0.854. Drainage developed a soil strength of 35 to 40 psi, which was retained even during saturation. There were strong indications that the problem soil could become trafficable even by big tractors when no water was applied to it for three weeks. When water was applied intermittently, it could become trafficable by hand tractors. However, it remained very soft and untrafficable under continuous water application. Other observations indicated that the effect of the methods of water application and different depths of drainage on soil sensitivity, plasticity index and calcium and sodium content was not significant at five percent level.

Isolation was easier when the disinfections period in ten percent sodium hypochlorite was prolonged from three to five minutes and grown in carrot dextrose agar. Streaking a loopful of conidial suspension had better sporulation than planting mycelial bits on agar slants. The conidia of both isolates were morphologically similar. They were slender to filiform, with truncate base and subacute tip. The conidiophores were shorter but wider than the conidia. The conidial and conidiophores length were highly variable whereas, their widths were less constant. The isolates formed abundant spores in V-8 juice agar. Maximum conidial yield was observed five to ten days after inoculation. Potato dextrose agar, cornmeal agar, carrot dextrose sugar and oatmeal agar had the best mycelial growth of the isolates. Cabbage agar, tobacco agar, onion agar and tobacco sucrose agar which supported sporulation maintained the least vegetative growth of the isolates. V-8 supported fair growth and higher conidial yield. The optimal pH for mycelial growth and sporulation ranged from 4.4 to 5.2 and the optimum temperature was 25-28?C. Red light and total darkness stimulated sporulation of the isolates but not vegetative growth. None among the carbon and nitrogen sources tested supported sporulation of the two isolates but all were able to sustain mycelial growth. Monosaccharides (fructose, galactose and glucose) and disaccharides (sucrose, lactose and maltose) supported the best mycelial growth of the two isolates. The trisaccharide, raffinose and polysaccharide dextrin provided better growth of isolate LB only. All the nitrogen sources supported vegetative growth of the two isolates.

The number of leaf spots increased with increasing inoculum density. Inoculum densities of 5,000 and 10,000 spores/ml produced lesion densities, which approximated lesion densities on plants grown in seedbeds and in the field.

Pedon 5, of an unknown soil series, was classified as a Vertic Ustifluvent, fine clayey, montmorillonitic, isohyperthermic. No group names were indicated for Pedons 1 and 2, as the Soil Taxonomy has not developed the necessary taxa yet. The characterization obtained for the said soils would somehow contribute additional information for future refinements of the Paleustult and Tropaquent subgroups. Influence of parent materials on most soils must have been nullified by time. Only Pedon 6 showed properties dominantly influenced by its limestone parent material. It had thick solum, calcic horizon and increased CaCo3 with depth. The mineralogy of this soil was dominantly calcitic. Vegetation and/or topography accounted for the differences or similarities among the soils. Degrees of weathering as revealed by the clay minerals were highly correlated with geomorphic surfaces. Pedon 1 required fertilization, particularly nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). Mulching with no tillage was necessary because of its low base saturation and strong susceptibility to leaching. The soil was best for fruit trees upland crops. Pedon 2, a Tropaquent, had high contents of soluble salts and exceedingly low available P. This soil required a combination of leaching with salt-free water, drainage and fertilization with N, P and zinc (ZN) for good crop growth. The soil was best suited to lowland rice. For Pedon 3, fertilization with N, P and calcium (Ca) was suggested. The soil was suited to upland crops and fruit trees. Pedon 4 as indicated by its failure to sustain rice growth, was clearly a problem soil. It was, in general, a sodic soil whose reclamation would require installing of proper drainage system; replacement of absorbed sodium (Na) by Ca and removal of the reaction products by leaching and drainage; plowing to improve physical conditions and fertilization with N and P. This soil was suited to lowland rice. Pedon 5 required application of N, P and K. It was best suited to upland crops and fruit trees. Pedon 6 was generally a fertile soil.

Five locally bred modern sugarcane varieties (MSV) namely Phil. 6559, Phil. 6533, Phil. 6421, Phil. 6019 and Phil. 6111 were less preferred by rats. These varieties had erect to reclining and erect to recumbent growth habits; medium to large solid stalks; medium to high (11.25-15.77%) fiber content; and high yield potentials (100 TC/ha and above 1.5 PS/TC). Radio-monitored female rats had larger mean area covered than those of male. Competition and changes in environment during preharvest, onset of harvest and postharvest periods may have caused the extensive wandering of the female. Rats traveled longer distances with 36.38 m/hour during onset of harvest than at preharvest period (13.93 m/hour). The rat ecosystem were disturbed during onset of harvest such that they sought shelter in bamboo groves, ditches, rock piles, creeks, brushes and other places for cover. Negros sugarcane in April to June, Crop Year 1976-77 suffered a mean total sugar loss (TSL) of 2.30% due to rats. The La Carlota mill district in February to April of the same crop year, likewise, showed a mean TSL of 1.92%. Island effect on rat-damaged stalks were observed in all districts except Victorias. The area method of sampling was considered the most practical, reliable and the least expensive among the three sampling techniques used. This method, however, required calculation of sample size needed to insure adequate sampling. Rat damage were highly correlated to dead stalks, tonnage reduction, juice deterioration and TSL. Dead stalks were the aftermath of rat damage. This was considered a total loss since no sugar could be recovered from this condition. Exposure and evaporation of juice caused tonnage reduction. Dead stalks showed significant to high correlations with juice deterioration and TSL. The fermenting condition of dead stalks when mixed with healthy millable stalks induced inversion of sugar and low rendement. Loss in weight showed highly significant correlations with juice deterioration and TSL. Juice deterioration, indicative of low rendement, was highly correlated to TSL and vice versa.

Biomass and total numbers of zooplankton were generally high during the cooler northeast monsoon period (November-February) and during the early intermonsoon in March with the peak in February 1977.

During these months, the lowest marketable yield was obtained because excess rainfall enhanced vegetative growth, hence, less carbohydrates were translocated to the roots for tuber formation. The sweet potato weevil was widely distributed in Tarlac, Pangasinan and Cavite especially if the crop was grown the whole year-round. Weevil density was greatly affected by the season, soil type and elevation. At higher elevation, the population was low. During the dry season, weevil build-up was very rapid. Soils with higher clay content shrunk when dry and cracked. This served as entry points, of the weevils to the tuber. A braconid parasite, Bracon cylasovorus, Roh. attacked the larvae of the weevil in the lower portion of the stem. Although the population was very low the whole year, this parasite was also present during rainy season. An earwig, Euborella sp. and ant, Tetramorium sp. preyed on the weevils during the rainy season.',NULL,NULL,'Mabesa, Virginia L.','PHILIPPINES RECOMMENDS, TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER, DIFFUSION OF INFORMATION, Communications',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2643,'2021-09-01 07:44:49','2021-09-01 07:44:49','Utilization of sugarcane bagasse mulch in tomato [Lycopersicon lycopersicum (L.) Karsten] production.','1981-09-01','Three sets of studies (greenhouse tests, laboratory, and field experiments) were conducted to gain information on how to maximize the utilization of sugarcane bagasse-mulch in tomato production using the cultivar Marikit. The initial greenhouse study showed that the four-month-old bagasse had an unfavorable effect on plant growth especially when applied 15 cm thick, as evidenced by the burning effect on the lower leaves, yellowing and stunting growth and lower yield. The two-month-old rice straw did not show any unfavorable effect. Four months after, the same bagasse-mulch favored the growth and increased the yield of the second crop. The seedbox study indicated that yellowing and stunting were caused by substances given off by the one- to five-month-old sugarcane bagasse. The petri dish test proved that these toxic substances were water-soluble and were present at higher concentration on the one- to five-month-old bagasse. Its low concentration on the six- to eight-month-old bagasse stimulated the growth of tomato seedlings. The final test in the field showed that mulching with eight-month-old increased plant heights over the unmulched plants. Increasing thickness of bagasse mulch delayed the flowering; induced greater chlorophyll synthesis and increased the number of flowers per plant, dry matter and yield of transplanted \'Marikit\' tomato when combined with nitrogen (N) fertilization. The unmulched plants had the least while rice straw had intermediate amounts. At 7.5-10 cm thick bagasse-mulch increased the soil organic matter after four months, which resulted to lower bulk density. The high moisture conserved on these treatments reduced the daily maximum temperature and favored the growth of decomposing microorganism, ultimately contributing further to the organic matter content of the soil. Substantial amount of N fertilizer, however, was needed to get maximum benefits. The thicker the mulch, the more N was needed. Therefore, 90, 150, and 210 kg N were needed for tomatoes when 5, 7.5, and 10 cm bagasse-mulches were used, respectively.

The palms were 60-70 years old and 15-20 m tall. There were 11 employees in the enterprise. The production practices were described and illustrated. The chemical analyses of the preserved toddy, freshly gathered toddy, wash and slop waste were determined. The economics of lambanog production was reported. The daily average toddy yield was 0.71 L/spadix and 1.42 L/palm. The daily collection was bulked together for four days and distilled on the fifth day. The distillery kettle had a capacity of 600 L. The rate of distillation was 570 L of toddy in seven hours, producing 91 L of 80? proof  lambanog. The preserved toddy contained 16.63% sucrose, less than 0.35% reducing sugards and no alcohol. The theoretical alcohol yield was 9.08 g/100 ml of toddy. The fermentation efficiency was 45.81% for the freshly gathered toddy and 59.25% for the wash. A 3.52% of the theoretical alcohol yield was included in the tabad (slope waste). The annual production of lambanog was 53,903 L of 80? proof, valued at P128,289.61.

Dry ipil-ipil leaves in BR-I was 20% while BR-II had 35% level on dry matter basis. A feeding experiment in a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial (two basal rations, with and without urea and CaHOP4 supplements) layout using 48 breeding goats distributed in a randomized complete block (RCB) design was likewise conducted to determine the performance of breeding goats kept in confinement fed with practical rations. The digestible CP, EE, NFE and TDN of the ration containing 20% dry ipil-ipil leaves, regardless of the levels of urea and CaHPO4 supplementation (BR-I), were significantly higher (P<0.05) than those fed with ration containing 35% dry ipil-ipil leaves, regardless of the levels of urea and CaHPO4 supplements (BR-II). The hematocrit and hemoglobin levels of blood from breeding goats fed with BR-I were significantly higher compared with those fed with BR-II. However, higher levels of ipil-ipil in the ration significantly depressed mean total protozoal counts (TPC) of rumen liquor and tended to increase the kidding rate of breeding goats. Regardless of the levels of dry ipil-ipil leaves (basal ration) and CaHPO4 supplementation, urea supplementation increased the daily CP and Ca intake. Likewise, the digestible CP of the ration and the mean TPC and total-N content of rumen liquor of breeding goats were increased significantly. Urea supplementation, regardless of the levels of dry ipil-ipil and CaHPO4 in the ration, caused an earlier occurrence of postpartum heat among breeding goats.

Laparotomy was performed on does 60 hours after exhibiting standing heats. The onset of the does\' estrus cycles after kidding varied from 14 to 140 days. Postpartum anestrus was shortened in all treated does with significantly lower mean values of 29.60, 29.80 and 27.90 days for 7.5, 10.0 and 12.5 mg dosages, respectively. The control does came into estrus 69.20 days postpartum. This significantly differed from the cycle lengths of treated does.  Increasing the dosage, however, from  7.5 mg to 10.0 and 12.5 mg had no significant effect.

The combined effects of temperature, rainfall, relative humidity and dosage significantly affected the onset of postpartum estrus. Regression analysis revealed a linear relationship between postpartum estrus and rainfall. Relative humidity and dosage exhibited negative linear relationships. Mean estrus durations of 21.10, 20.10, 10.10 and 26.80 hours were observed for 0, 7.5, 10.0, and 12.5 mg dosages, respectively. These however, were not statistically different from each other.

Stocking densities tested were 25, 50, and 75/sq m for the wild fry and 15, 30, and 45/sq m for the hatchery-produced postlarvae. Growth rate of the postlarvae taken from the wild differed significantly (P<0.10) among the treatments, at 5.7 - 9.6 mg/day. The group at 50 postlarvae/sq m had the highest rate of growth, while that at 75 fry/sq m  had the lowest 30 days after culture. Periodic growth rate was fastest during the second 10-day period and slowest during the first 10-day period of the experiment.

It explored the system of rent capitalism operating in the village and the conditions, which predisposed the farmers toward dependence on rent capitalists. The factors, which ushered the integration of Maragol into the capitalist network, were at play long before the proclamation of the first land reform program in the 50s. However, the development of land, labor, product, commodity and credit markets in Maragol proceeded at a fast pace with the introduction and adoption of the new rice varieties and the land reform program coupled with the extension of technical and credit services in the 70s. Since the new rice varieties depended on inputs, which at the time of the study could not be produced in the farm, and on an increasing demand for labor in some phases of production, the entire seed-fertilizer/chemical package required more capital on the part of farmers. It was the dependence on high-yielding varieties and capital inputs, which heightened the need to enter or reinforce the debt relations between farmer-borrowers on one hand and the creditors, on the other. While the seed-fertilizer technology reinforced the dependence of farmers on rent capitalists, rent capitalists themselves had an important role to play in the introduction and adoption of capital-intensive machines like the hand tractor in rice production. The availability of the credit made it easier for farmers, for instance, to shift from the use of water buffalo to mechanized farming implements. Reactions to rent capitalism varied among groups. The big farmers were generally indifferent but they were quick to articulate some of the negative aspects of the arrangement. While some small and medium farmers complained about the operations of rent capitalists, the majority considered the system as necessary to sustain production and improve living standards. To this majority, rent capitalism was subjectively good because it was functional. It was very likely that rent capitalism would prevail given the absence of accessible institutional sources of credit, the profitability of lending to a captive clientele, the subjective perception on the part of the majority of borrowers that the system was beneficial and the consequent lack of organization among a stratified farming sector to bargain with rent capitalists on terms and conditions of loans or to seek alternatives to the system. The possibility of organizing farmers, however, was made difficult by the subjective perception of the benefits from rent capitalism.',NULL,NULL,'Manopla, Rosario R.','SUGAR CANE, NUTRIENT UPTAKE, MAGNESIUM, NITROGEN, POTASSIUM, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2650,'2021-09-01 07:44:49','2021-09-01 07:44:49','An evaluation of the Bayanihan School program of the Palawan National Agricultural College.','1982-09-01','The study was conducted among two types of clientele of the Palawan National Agricultural College (PNAC) Bayanihan School Program (BSP) in five selected barrios in Palawan.

There was no sprouting from fragmented stolons of S. grossus and matured seeds did not germinate. Tubers sprouted within three to five days after planting. Leaf production of plants grown from tubers started soon after sprouting, increased rapidly from the second to the third week after emergence, slowed down afterwards and finally leveled off on the 9th week. Plant height increased rapidly from the 1st to the 5th week after emergence of the mother plant. Increase in plant height was most rapid from the 3rd to the 5th week, slowed down after the 5th week and leveled off onwards. Shoot formation commenced two weeks from emergence, continued to increase beyond the 4th week and gradually slowed down from the 5th week to the 10th week.

Average smut infection with wound paste inoculation was 41.25% as compared with 17.0-18.0% in case of dip, paste, spray and dusting methods. Only one out of the 20 hybrids tested were resistant to very highly resistant in all five inoculation methods. While resistance in dip, paste, spray and dusting methods could be due to morphological barrier afforded by the bud scales, resistance in wound paste may have some physiological or chemical basis.

The wound paste method could be employed to supplement results from dip inoculation particularly in selecting for parental materials in a breeding program where higher degree of resistance is necessary.

White potato and lettuce suppressed Plutella larvae and adults during the heading stage of cabbage. High yield was obtained from the cabbage monoculture and cabbage-lettuce intercrop. The lowest yield, obtained from cabbage-potato intercrop, was due to shading of white potato on cabbage plants.

A pot experiment was designed using two NPK levels, namely, 60-30-30 and 90-60-60 kg/ha, and two sources of organic matter, poultry manure and dried ipil-ipil leaves. The experiments consisted of two croppings with cotton, ipil-ipil and corn as test crops, all harvested at flowering time. Irrespective of the levels of NPK and source of organic matter, the treatment NPK + organic matter gave the best growth in terms of plant height, dry matter production and stem diameter. Addition of organic matter alone to the tailings improved growth than the plants that received NPK alone. Addition of low or high levels of NPK alone did not improve the growth of the plants. The response was comparable to the plants grown in tailings alone. There was marked increased uptake of the major elements by the plants that received combined NPK and organic matter. The tailings contained very low amounts of essential nutrients and organic matter, had high pH and bulk density and had very poor structure for plant growth. The marked improvement in plant growth in the treatment with NPK + organic matter was attributed to the beneficial effect of the treatment on the above properties.

A total of 174 respondents were included in this study; 81 of whom represented the consortium constituents, 26 were researchers and 67 were LGUs/NGOs and farmers. Data were gathered using survey questionnaire among the members of the RTWG, RACO and RMIS of both CLARRDEC and WESVARRDEC. An in-depth interview was conducted among the members of the RRDCC, RRDCC Chairmen and Consortium Directors. A focus group discussion and interview were administered among the researchers. Likewise,  a questionnaire was personally administered among the LGUs/NGOs and farmers. The study showed a higher interagency communication in WESVARRDEC than in CLARRDEC as manifested through individual, group and mass media contact. For the type of frequency communication, CLARRDEC gave the highest score to meetings while face-to-face interaction ranked highest in WESVARRDEC. The level of interagency coordination was exhibited through joint projects and activities. Results showed that WESVARRDEC had the higher degree of coordination over that of CLARRDEC. Meanwhile, the activity that registered the highest participation among the CLARRDEC respondents  was identification of research gaps and initiation of R&D activities, while the conduct of the USWAG R&D information caravan ranked highest in WESVARRDEC. Results also showed that there was a relationship between the level of interagency communication and coordination, communication and participation, and interagency participation and coordination in CLARRDEC. However, there was no relationship of the above-mentioned hypothesis in WESVARRDEC. Moreover, results also showed that levels of interagency communication, coordination and participation were statistically different between CLARRDEC and WESVARRDEC.

Externally, symptoms on the stalks and ears consisted of brownish-green bands of soft and water-soaked lesions. Internal symptoms on these parts consisted of soft and watery mass of degraded and disorganized tissues that emitted a disagreeable odor. Ten representative isolates studied for their morphological, cultural and biochemical characteristics closely resembled Erwinia carotovora var. chrysanthemi, the causal bacterium of stalk rot described by previous workers. Based on pathogenicity tests of 40 isolates on four test materials, these could be grouped into three distinct pathogenic strains. Furthermore, these isolates varied relatively in virulence and aggressiveness. Inoculation experiments revealed that any part of the host could be invaded, provided the bacterium is introduced into the tissues through wounds or injuries. The stalk rot bacterium was detected in the respective rhizospheres of three weeds commonly found in upland areas, namely, kulitis (Amaranthus spinosus L.), kamo-kamotihan (Ipomea triloba L.) and gulasiman (Portulaca oleracea L.). The corn borer (Ostrinia furnacallis Guenee) could introduce the pathogen from diseased to healthy plants. Application of carbofuran to control this insect could significantly minimize the disease. The microclimate in the high-population density plots (120,000 corn plants/ha) significantly favored high incidence of stalk rot as compared with the low population density plots (55,000 plants/ha). Apparently, a combination of high relative humidity (83% and above) and low air temperature (27?C and below) was ideal for heavy disease occurrence. Fertilizer and lime experiments showed that high rates of nitrogen and NPK fertilizers minimized stalk rot damage.

The results showed that cassava with ipil-ipil strip was more effective in minimizing surface runoff (SRO) and soil loss. A total of 1.8% SRO and 0.602 t/ha sediment loss were obtained from cassava with strip (C2) compared  to 7.5% SRO and 26.137 t/ha sediment yield for peanut alone (P1), 5.4% SRO and 8.22 t/ha sediment yield for peanut with strip (P2) and 6.6% SRO and 2.07 g t/ha sediment yield for cassava without strip(C1).

The objectives were to 1) determine the age of cotton seedling that was most sensitive to daylengths; 2) evaluate the effects of photoperiod on the growth, yield and yield components, and total dry matter content of cotton; and 3) compare the overall response of the different cotton varieties to different photoperiods. Four cotton varieties were tested, namely, UPLC (Batac), Deltapine 16 (Australian), Stoneville 106 and Reba P279. Cotton seedlings of these varieties at ages 10, 15 and 20 days after emergence were subjected to photoperiod treatments of 10, 12 and 14 hours light daily. The treatments were arranged in a 4 x 3 x 3 factorial RCBD with three replications each. Results showed that the 20-day-old seedlings subjected to photoperiod were the most sensitive to daylengths. The 20-day-old seedlings exposed to ten hours light daily squared 2.6 and 6.8 days earlier than the 10- and 15-day-old seedlings, respectively. The length of day or photoperiod was a factor of importance, which affected the growth, yield and yield components, and total dry matter content of cotton. The ten-hour-photoperiod treatment produced the tallest plants (80.7 cm) and had the most branches (7.0) compared to the 12- and 14-hour photoperiod treatments.

However, any economic benefits derived must be balanced against the required quality compromises that could be expected from this substitution. Blending or proportioning recycled fibers that optimized their properties is one practical alternative. Several treatment processes should be used to at least regain if not improve the inherent qualities of recycled fibers from varied waste paper grades. The different waste paper grade inputs, the treatment processes and the resultant qualities of paper sheets were conceptualized as a multivariable production system with input-process-output criterion. A mathematical programming model for the system was formulated based on the concepts of linearity that systems of linear equations algebraically defined the functional relationships simultaneously. Thus, the blend optimization problem was reduced to a form amenable to Linear programming (LP) model classification. The model consisted of various pulp types produced from the different waste paper sources and treatments as the decision variables or potential blend components.  This study aimed to minimize specific blend\'s cost while satisfying standard minimum strength and optical property requirements and other technical constraints. Linear blending theory for paper furnish was validated a priori through actual experimentation to operationalize the model. Results showed that the parameters considered such as pulp freeness; burst, tear and tensile indices; brightness; and relative cost coefficients varied linearly as functions of the different recycled pulp types\' proportions in the blend. Hence, the resultant properties of a furnish blend consisting of two or several pulp types could be predicted from the summation of the properties\' proportions in the blend. Actual laboratory experimentation was done to obtain necessary input data for solving the formulated LP model. An iterative process algorithm was then conducted in a computer for every commercial paper grade considered under three separate program solutions. Results showed that when decision variables consisted pure recycled pulps, there were no feasible blends for paper grades of highly demanding specifications. Introducing primary pulp types into the model improved the number of grades with optimal furnish blends. Deleting the raw material restrictions with the assumption that waste paper materials were abundant and their relative availabilities did not vary, an optimal furnish blend solution for all paper grades was derived except for heavy-duty kraft paper.  Improved recovery and proper sorting of waste papers were implied for more efficient and systematized recycled paper production. Respective furnish blends of some paper grades were generally composed of recycled pulps from the same waste paper grades compensated by some amounts of primary pulps, while pure recycled pulps under specific treatments composed other furnishes. Additional statistical analysis proved the wide variations of the different parameters with the treatment combinations. As an integral part of any mathematical programming model, sensitivity analysis was conducted. It showed that the formulated model\'s different input parameters could vary within derived ranges without changing the optimal furnish blend or making it infeasible. The overall results outlined a methodology that could lead to the development of a more realistic and comprehensive mathematical model for a multivariable recycled paper furnish blend optimization applicable to actual large-scale operations.',NULL,NULL,'Pagdilao, Cesario R.','FISHES, SLIP MOUTHS, TAXONOMY, GROWTH, MORTALITY, Marine science',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2018-05-04-03_ab_55040.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(2666,'2021-09-01 07:44:49','2021-09-01 07:44:49','Isolation and partial characterization of citrus tristeza closterovirus in the Philippines.','1981-09-01','Isolates of Citrus tristeza closterovirus (CTV) were collected from Davao and Batangas.

Fruit set and retention in calamondin were likewise not affected. Fruit growth and final size at maturity both in sweet orange and pummelo were not affected by chemical sprays. Fruits of ethephon-treated pummelo (50, 100 and 150 ppm) and sweet orange (50 and 150 ppm) ripened earlier than the control. Greater percent edible portion was realized in fruits obtained from paclobutrazol-sprayed trees of sweet orange. Percent edible portion of pummelo was not significantly affected. The total soluble solid (TSS), titratable acidity (TA) and reducing sugar (RS) of sweet orange fruits were not affected. Total number of fruits, weight and number of marketable pummelo fruits at harvest increased on trees sprayed with paclobutrazol, ethephon and potassium nitrate except at 100 ppm ethephon and 10.0 g/L potassium nitrate. Potassium nitrate at 5.0 g/L was most effective and optimal to affect increased fruit yield. Fruit yield and number of marketable fruits of sweet orange increased with application of ethephon and potassium nitrate. Again, potassium nitrate at 5.0 g/L gave the best result. Spraying sweet orange and pummelo trees at a rate of 5.0 g/L potassium nitrate increased the net income by 217.60% and 272.49%, respectively, compared to the control trees.',NULL,NULL,'Masipequena, Andres B.','SOCIAL FORESTRY, FOREST MANAGEMENT, ISABELA, Forestry',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2018-07-09-03_ab_54932.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(2669,'2021-09-01 07:44:49','2021-09-01 07:44:49','Factors related to the institutionalization of the farming systems approach (FSA) in Region X.','1982-09-01','The study sought to determine the level of institutionalization of the farming systems approach (FSA) in the operationalization of research and development activities of the Department of Agriculture (DA), Region X as perceived by its technical personnel; to find out the level of institutionalization of the FSA at the barangay level as perceived by farmers: and to identify the factors, which facilitated their institutionalization. The data were gathered from 121 DA technical staff directly involved in research and extension activities and 77 farmer-cooperators. The DA technical staff respondents were permanent employees of the agency mostly in their early 40s with a baccalaureate degree and an average work experience of 16 years. A typical farmer in Northern Mindanao was 47 years old with an elementary education and 19 years of cultivating about 3 ha farm with an average annual income of  P26,114.00. About 40% of the farmers were owner-cultivators; the rest were leasees (38.96%) and tenants (20.78%).  Indicators of institutionalization studies were centrality of farmers in research and extension, problem-solving orientation, location specificity, interdisciplinary team approach and farmer participation. Results showed that on the overall there was a high level of institutionalization of FSA. Four out of five characteristics of FSA were practiced by the respondents. Interdisciplinary team approach, the fourth FSA feature, was the lone characteristic found not institutionalized as this was not actually practiced in the agency. As  indicators of institutionalization, centrality of farmers in research and development was influenced by technical staff respondents\' awareness of the sufficiency and availability of financial support, awareness of the support from various units of DA, perception of the support from DA management, adequacy of Regional Integrated Agricultural Research System (RIARS) infrastructure and the farmers\' awareness of FSA concepts. Problem solving, on the other hand, was enhanced by the technical staff respondents\' age, experience, awareness of the support from various units of DA, perception of the support from DA management, adequacy of RIARS/Provincial Technology Verification Team (PTVT) manpower, adequacy of RIARS infrastructure, adequacy of policy support, and farmers\' education. In terms of FSA\'s location specific attribute, the technical staff respondents\' age, work, experience, sufficiency and availability of financial support, awareness of the support from various units of DA, perception of the support from DA management and adequacy of RIARS infrastructure had significant associations with the level of institutionalization. Furthermore, farmers\' awareness on the sufficiency and availability of RIARS financial support had a strong bearing on the level of routinization. The technical staff respondents\' awareness of the support from various units of DA and their perception on the support from management and farmer\'s income had quite improved the level of institutionalization of FSA\'s fourth attribute, interdisciplinary team approach, although the results were not significant at 5% level.

The study further explored how these factors were related to access to resources, decision-making, labor contribution and length of participation in the soybean program. A total of 227 respondents, 114 men and 113 women, selected through multi-stage cluster sampling was interviewed. The respondents consisted of soybean cooperators and their spouses from four villages in three municipalities of Isabela, Philippines. Data were gathered from February to June 1995 through field observations, participatory rural appraisal and survey method. A structured interview schedule incorporating the gender analytical framework was used for the survey. Data were analyzed using frequency counts, percentages, mean, ranges and standard deviation. Relationships and associations were determined by chi-square, contingency coefficient, multiple corrrelation and multiple regression analyses. The discriminant analysis identified distinguishing variables between innovators-early adopters, and late adopters. It also verified group membership accuracy. Results were presented by location and were disaggregated by gender. Differences in economic level, area of land cultivated, owned and planted to soybean yield, tenurial status, source of first information on soybean, adoption rate of the soybean technology, length of participation in the soybean program, and soybean production practices were observed between and among sites. Problems and effects of soybean production also differed among locations. Between male and female respondents, differences were noted in terms of educational attainment (particularly at the college level), information needs, membership in organizations, attendance in soybean-related trainings/seminars, level of technology use and labor contribution in soybean production and postproduction operations. Ownership of radio was high but availability of printed materials was low. Nearly all respondents were knowledgeable about soybean production practices; however, knowledge of soybean utilization among female respondents varied among locations. Male and female farmers had different soybean informations needs, but both preferred training/lecture as a communication method. Innovators and early adopters were influencial sources of first information about soybean, together with the Department of Agriculture (DA) extension worker and Municipal Agricultural Office (MAO)-agricultural technicians. However, the extension worker and agricultural technicians were consistently the sources of technical knwledge of soybean package of technology (POT). Patterns of decision-making were also obseved. \"Joint husband and wife decisions\" were made in areas which required capital outlay, involved risks or concerned the welfare of the family. Independent decisions by either husband or wife were influenced by labor contribution, task-specificity and by existing norms and culture. Male respondents contributed more labor in production/field activities; while women provided more labor in postproduction operations, particularly in cleaning soybean. Shared tasks in soybean operations were planting, weeding, harvesting and cleaning soybean, purchasing inputs and credit procurement. The study found significant relationship between personal, household and farming characteristics with organizational membership, attendance in soybean trainings/seminars, knowledge of soybean POT and length of participation in soybean production. Correlation results showed that several personal, household and farming characteristics had significant and positive association with labor contribution in soybean operations. Other characteristics, however, had inverse realtion. Educational and economic levels and area of land cultivated and owned had negative correlation with input in production labor in both male and female respondents. Multiple regression analysis revealed that certain variables had varying effect on men and women, and within a particular gender. Household size had consistent positive influence on female respondents\' attendance to trainings/seminars and labor input in production and auxiliary activities, but had negative effect to male respondents\' labor input in auxiliary activities. In men, educational level was positive to labor input in auxiliary activities but negative to input in production labor. Among women, education was positive to attendance in trainings/seminars but negative to input in production labor. The results of the discriminant analysis showed that attendance in trainings/seminars, organizational membership, area of land owned, and economic and educational levels distinguished the innovators-early adopters from the late adopters. The discriminant analysis correctly classified 80% of cooperators as members of the group to which they actually belonged.

Bulk leaf primings were gathered from the farmers and were classified as to their position in the stalk. In general, the Philippine native tobacco leaf was characterized as follows: length, 33.33 cm; width, 10.91 cm; leaf area, 259.27 sq cm; breadth index, 3.05; lamina content, 65.62%; midrib content, 5.66%, weight/leaf, 2.73 g; specific leaf weight, 9.92 mg/sq cm; thickness, 0.257 mm; and combustion rate, 22.38 sq mm/second. Cured native tobacco leaves were generally medium to dark brown. The extent of leaf damage caused by insect injury and postharvest operations ranged from 5% to more than 50% of the total leaf. As regards growing location, the delta-grown tobacco was better in terms of leaf size, weight/leaf, color, texture and extent of damage. However, upland-grown tobacco, which resulted to a higher specific leaf weight and more uniform combustion rate was thicker.

The still unidentified species of stain-producing fungus produced variously-shaped black lesions which form a scale-like pattern on unscraped poles (Type II black stain). Empty globose to flask-shaped fruiting bodies were formed under the epidermis of infected poles. Symptoms and signs of black stain similar to those found in naturally-infected samples appeared in poles inoculated with the isolated organisms. The dark pigment of the hyphae imparted the dark gray, dark blue or black color of the infected poles. The fungi disorganized the parenchyma cells and destroyed some portions of the walls that resulted in the loss of rigidity of the tissues. The two black stain fungi reduced significantly in end and side hardness, end and side nail-holding power, compression strength, static bending and specific gravity of palasan poles.

The sites were also deficient in nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, and relatively low in calcium, magnesium and sodium.

It  also analyzed the trend in rubber production, area, yield and price. For Mindanao and its regions, the trend in rubber area, production and price were generally increasing and followed the same trend pattern. Rubber production, hectarage and price grew at the rate of 17, 10 and 5%, respectively, from 1960 to 1979. On the other hand, rubber yield per tree fluctuated erratically and increase in rubber production was mainly due to increase in rubber plantings. Periodically, the trend was divided into four periods, namely: 1) a period of abrupt increase in area coupled with slightly increasing production and fluctuating but generally decreasing yield from 1960 to 1964, 2) a moderately decreasing area with steady growth in production and fluctuating, but generally increasing yield from 1965 to 1968, 3) slightly increasing area and production coupled with fluctuating but generally decreasing yield from 1969 to 1973 and 4) lately, a period of highly increasing area and production with fluctuating yield from 1974 to 1977. The supply response analysis showed that the two regions in Mindanao had different response behavior to rubber price. In planting response, rubber farmers of NE Mindanao were sensitive to temporary price fluctuations while those of SW Mindanao were not. In both regions, planting response to rubber price was elastic while tapping response, inelastic. Tapping activity of farmers was influenced by the available tappable trees rather than by the prevailing market condition.

The three major Tausug provinces of Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi were surveyed to identify the indigenous agroforestry systems. After a reconnaisance survey, Sulu was found as the lone Tausug province that practiced indigenous agroforestry systems. Hence, most of the data of this study came from this province. Primary and secondary data were used in the analyses of the study. Methods used in collecting primary data included key informant technique, unstructured and structured interviews, and participant observation.

The direct effects on target species and indirect effects on unintended organisms in rice ecosystem were assessed. The laboratory efficacy of controlled release carbofuran formulations against the brown plant hopper, Nilaparvata lugens Stal peaked between 10 and 20 days after treatment with mortality rates from 80% to 100% compared to the 25% mortality rate by conventional granule and persisted up to 60 days after treatment. Against the striped stem borer, less than 20% mortality rates were obtained. In the field, controlled release granules reduced rice whorl maggot damage up to 36 days compared to 28 days by conventional granule. The GO 3009 was more effective against stem borer attacks and significantly reduced green leafhopper population at 90% compared to 49% reduction by conventional granule. The GO 3009 exerted a high degree of insect control at the tillering stage while GO 3012 was active during the booting stage. Higher yield was obtained from lower rates of application with GO 3009 registering the highest yield at 38% above the control and 15% higher than the conventional formulation. The least natural enemy diversity value at the tillering stage occurred on GO 3039 and at the booting stage from GO 3012 plots. The indices of diversity of predators and parasitoids were not significantly different and that makeup of natural enemies was homogeneous in all treatments. The GO 3012 favored the spiders obtaining the highest spider diversity value. Toxicity test of controlled release and conventional carbofuran showed the wolf spider, Lycosa pseudoannulata Boesenberg and Strand, was sensitive to carbofuran regardless of formulation. The GO 3009 was not accumulated in fish after 30 days\' exposure. Residues in whole grain were within the tolerance limit and, therefore, controlled release carbofuran formulations could safely be used in rice. They were not detected in watermelon, a rotation crop after rice. A rapid initial burst followed by a steady release characterized the release of controlled release granules in the laboratory with the larger particle-sized granules releasing more active ingredient than with smaller granule. In the field, the release pattern showed a steady increase for the first few weeks and declined slowly as a function of aging time.

The data gathered were coded, categorized, summarized and analyzed using descriptive statistics, Spearman Correlation Coefficient and chi-square analyses. The respondents were dominated by males (79%). The average age was 50 years, 31 years of which were spent in farming. Educational attainment was low, with 85% in the elementary level. The average number of children was five. Ninety-five percent were tenants, with landholdings ranging from 0.25 to 8 ha and an average net farm income of P1,109 per year. About 73% of the respondents initiated seeking information about soil conservation. However, only 6% received the information regularly. Only 29% were members of organizations. Many (68%) had not attended seminars and trainings related to agriculture. Majority (86%) were not familiar and had no contact with an agricultural extension agent. Television was the commonly owned media (58%) followed by cassette (43%) and transistor radio (39%). The most preferred sources of information, among others, were cofarmers (99%), personal visit of a technician (98%) and actual demonstration (94%). Majority of the network links in the village were related by blood. The degree the farmer was linked to all other farmers in the village ranged from 0 to 0.07, with a low average of 0.02 connectedness. Reciprocal ties ranged from 0 to 1. The average degree of reciprocity (0.1) was relatively low. A respondent communicated with his or her link for an average of three days in a week.

Indiscriminate use of chemical pesticides had resulted in multiple resistances to a wide range of chemicals and the reduction of natural enemy populations. These problems had necessitated an alternative approach to the control of DBM based on a sound ecological knowledge of the pest. The population of diamondback moth and its natural enemies were evaluated on cabbage, intercropped with tomato, sweet pepper, peanut and cowpea, or planted alone. This study was conducted to determine the influence of the different crop combinations and cabbage monoculture on the population dynamics of DBM and its natural enemies and to know the effects of the various plant extracts on the oviposition behavior of DBM on cabbage. Significantly, lower DBM populations were observed in all cabbage intercrop treatments compared with a cabbage monoculture. The lower DBM population was exhibited by cabbage-tomato intercrop. Intercropping was beneficial in reducing DBM population but it did not reduce the overall pest damage and was not enough to maintain marketable yields. Other pests such as Spodoptera litura (Fabr.) and Myzus persicae Sulzer were also observed infesting cabbage as early as two weeks after transplanting (WAT). These other pests also contributed to poor quality and lower yield of cabbage. The population of natural enemies was relatively low perhaps because of frequent application of chemical pesticides in the adjacent areas, which inhibited their population buildup. The predators observed were spiders (Thomisidae and Oxyopidae), earwigs (Labiduridae) and ladybird beetle (Coccinelidae).

Leaf jury rating (LIR) was used to evaluate damage done by corn borer larvae at the vegetative stage. There was a highly significant LIR (severe) on plants artificially infested with six and eight corn borer larvae per plant. Higher density resulted in higher leaf injury. Single infestation during the tasseling stage at 45 days after planting (DAP) and a double infestation (at midwhorl and tasseling stages) gave a significantly higher average number of broken tassels (0.73 to 1.0) than a single application during the midwhorl stage (35 DAP). The nonsignificant difference observed among averages at different density levels (two, four, six and eight larvae per plant) implied that even the lowest density could cause a broken tassel. Analyses by simple and linear regression revealed that broken tassel was a good index in estimating yield loss. There was a corresponding decrease in yield (Y) as the mean number of broken tassel (X) increased. This was reflected in the equation Y = 0.22 - 0.126 X. There was a significant high grain weight (10,864.18 kg/ha) when plants were completely protected from borer population (borer-free caged plants). Based on this, a significant lower grain weight was observed on plants with six and eight larvae per plant infested once during the midwhorl stage. The percent yield losses were 43.26 and 46.26, respectively. The same results were observed in other treatments with yield losses ranging from 43.60 to 59.40%. The naturally infested plants treated with insecticides significantly gave higher grain weight (5,155.42 kg/ha) over the untreated plants (3,355.44 kg/ha) with a yield loss of 51.77 and 68.59, respectively. The percent yield loss (Y) increased as the number of larvae (X) increased in the midwhorl stage. This was was reflected in the equation Y = 34.20 + 1.5 X).

The geographical and altitudinal distribution of the insect was studied nationwide. Ips was present only in Luzon, usually in the central part, and thrives well from elevations of 350 to 2,300 m above sea level although there was an instance when the species attacked pine logs at 150 m. Adults usually started to fly and bore into the bark of their host from 0700 to 1000 hours during summer when air temperature exceeded 18?C. Adults continued to fly and bore until the later part of the day when air temperature was still above 18?C. They were more actively flying in the open area than under the forest canopy. Meteorological factors, like rain and strong wind, affected the flight pattern and activity of the insect. Bark thickness of the logs did not seem to affect much the density of attack and brood production of the beetle although the rate of attack and production of brood were much faster on logs stored in the open than those stored under the forest canopy. Emergence of adults on logs stored in the open was much earlier and longer than that in the shade. The total number of emerging beetles did not differ in the two areas. During the early part of their emergence period a larger proportion of emerging adults were males. Adult ips beetles were capable of readily attacking both horizontally and vertically stored logs. The fire-affected trees studied were not successfully attacked by the beetles because of the low population of the beetles. Attacking beetles were killed by resinosis. The trees later recovered in the following rainy season.

The study was conducted for 120 days in ponds of approximately 500 sq m each. Results indicated that mean net production for tilapia in all treatments did not differ significantly suggesting that tilapia cultured in combination with carp and clam had growth rates comparable with tilapia alone. Mean net production for carp differed significantly because of differences in stocking rates. The clams showed relatively poor growth in all treatments and apparently had not contributed to increased tilapia production. There was no evidence that the clam at a density of 500/ha helped in either reduction of waste products  and maintenance of cleaner water. There was marked evidence of food competition between tilapia and carp in Treatments I and II. The degree of competition was considered greater in population with lower density (Treatment II). This might be caused by the size attained by the carp in this treatment, such that, they might have established stable feeding positions over tilapia. Percentage weight distribution for tilapia and carp showed more than 50% attaining weight range of 100-200 g. The weight range for tilapia was almost identical in all treatments. However, carp at the same level varied considerably. Carp in Treatment I showed 89.6% within the range of 100-200 g compared with Treatment II with 58.8%.

Experiment II dealt with registered seed production while Experiment III evaluated certified seed production. In Experiment I, no significant differences in seed yield per plant, plant height and ear height were observed among inbred lines. However, they differed significantly in number of days to tasseling, silking and physiological maturity. Seed yield per plant was significantly lower in 80,000 than in 53,333 plants/ha. Significant increase in yield was obtained when nitrogen fertilizer was increased from 90 kg to 120 kg N/ha. Other characters measured gave varying response to plant density and nitrogen level. Experiment II showed that seed yield per plant of Ph 102-38 was not significantly different in 1:2 and 1:3 parent ratio. The 1:3 parent ratio gave significant increase in seed yield per hectare for Ph 110-13 but not for Ph 102-38.

Variables considered were moisture contents and nitrogen rates. The treatments imposed consisted of adjusting conditions to 1/3 bar percentage, 3-bar and 10-bar percentages for changing water content, whereas, nitrogen rates applied included 0, 40, 80, 120, and 160 kg N/ha. Ammonia volatilization decreased with time. The average total N losses increased as the amount of N application was increased although the percentage of loss from applied N did not substantially differ between N rates of application. Thus, the rate of volatilization increased with increasing N rate applied but remained unaffected despite changes in moisture conditions. In all, losses through NH3 volatilization was 14% of applied N. On the matter of apparent NH4+ fixation, the proportion of the added NH4-N not extracted by KCl was higher at lower concentrations of added N. It was assumed that the nonextractable NH4- N was the apparent fixed NH4- N in the soil, which was about 15% of the applied N. From these two sets of data, a  balance between total N added, losses, and the portion that remained was estimated. It was noted that total N loss increased with the rate of nitrogen application irrespective of water content. This constituted about 30% of the total N. If this loss was permanent, then this amount could reduce the expected positive response of plants from the nutrient in the soil. A part of nitrogen added was not accounted for in the balance sheet indicating that this had remained undetected or lost through other mechanisms. On the other hand, there were instances when N analyzed were greater than what was added, which might imply possible contribution from native N. In addition, NO3- N content was higher at higher moisture contents while in the case of NH4- N the opposite was indicated. In this regard, it was suspected that nitrifiers were more active at higher moisture contents below saturation. The rate of converting NH4- N to NO3- N was calculated using the amount of NH4- N in the soil with time. This assumed that any decrease in this form was caused by its conversion to NO3- N.

Based on fresh weight of top, cane and root, height and girth, filtercake improved sugarcane growth better than Temik 15G.

In the field experiment, organic materials (filtercake, sawdust, rice hull, and bagasse) and nematicides (Temik 15G, Basudin 10G, furadan 3G and Mocap 5G) considerably suppressed populations of Pratylenchus, tylenchorhynchus, Rotylenchus, Criconemoides, Helicotylenchus, Hemicycliophora, Rotylenchus and Hoplolaimus attacking sugarcane. The sustained control of the organic materials ranged from four to nine months whereas the nematicides lasted from one to seven months.

Stomach examination showed that S. temminckii was strictly insectivorous. Other bats collected were either frugivorous (Ptenochirus jagorii, Cynopterus brachyotis brachyotis, Rousettus amplexicaudatus, Eonycteris spelea glandifera, Pteropus vampyrus lanensis and Haplonycteris fischeri), insectivorous  (Rhinolophus subrufus subrufus, Rhinolophus anderseni anderseni, Myotis herrei, Hipposideros diadema anderseni and Megaderma spasma spasma), or nectarivorous  (Macroglossus lagochilus lagochilus). As was generally recognized, the larger bats (Megachiroptera) were either fruit or nectar feeders while the smaller bats (Microchiroptera) were mostly insect feeders. The megachiropterans inhabited both lowland and mountain terrains where fruiting and flowering trees were available most periods of the year, while the microchiropterans were strongly associated with lowland areas of cultivation and human habitation. Food analysis was conducted by microscopic analysis of slides prepared from stomach contents and compared with reference slides of specimens collected in the various study sites.

It operated on the idea that there were available lands within the forest concessions, which could be profitably devoted to food production without sacrificing forest conservation principles and objectives. This study identified some factors affecting the attainment of FIFPP\'s goal. Data were gathered by interviewing 151 farm laborers and 22 managers of eight logging firms in Mindanao. The effective implementation of FIFPP was likely to be affected by biological factors such as land and weather conditions in the area, human factors such as the psychological make up of both groups of respondents, and organizational factors such as availability of production inputs and government assistance. Both farm laborer and manager respondents were aware of the growing food insufficiency of the country and believed that the combined efforts of the government and private sector would be an ideal approach to the problem. The managers knew more about the FIFPP than the farm laborers. Managers from the firms participating in bigger-scale food production perceived FIFPP as helpful in partly solving the country\'s profitable venture in the future, hence their enthusiasm and commitment to continue and expand their projects. FIFPP implementors found the availability of essential production inputs such as irrigation and drainage facilities, credit, and technical assistance from the government necessary in the effective implementation of PD 472. There was also a lack of external organizations supporting the program. All the firms followed a somewhat similar scheme in land development and production, but differed to a certain extent in the level of resources or combination of resources used in all these operations. All the firms studied said they would continue their farming ventures under PD 472 but suggested some modifications such as giving them the option to raise alternative crops or livestocks suited to the conditions in their respective concession areas. The production inputs used by all the firms included newly recruited and detailed workers, and newly bought and transferred equipment from logging department; infrastructure built and rice mills; and field offices constructed. Of the program\'s effectiveness in terms of meeting its basic goal, evidence showed negative attainment. However, the social benefits from the program as indicated by the respondents, compensated for the failure in the attainment of the basic program goal. Finally, the problems besetting the FIFPP participating firms were economic, such as loan assistance and price support; political, such as peace and order condition and squatting; and biological, such as unsuitability of land and weather in the concession area for rice/corn production.

For the pure coconut stand, out of the gross rainfall of 1,635.10 mm and 1,296.36 mm occurred as throughfall and 96.82 mm as stemflow. Net precipitation was, therefore, 1,393.18 mm (or 85.20%) while interception loss was 241.92 mm (or 14.80%). For C + L, 1,141.92 mm occurrd as throughfall and 91.66 mm as stemflow. Net precipitation was, therefore, 1,232.98 mm (or 75.41%) while interception loss was 402.12 mm (or 24.59%). Interception storage capacities of pure coconut and C + L were 1.34 mm and 1.51 mm of rainfall, respectively.  Predictive equations for throughfall, stemflow net precipitation and interception loss as a function of total rainfall were developed following a linear relationship.  Comparison of means by T-test showed that throughfall, net precipitation, and interception loss from pure coconut and C + L were significantly different from each other. Data collected for surface runoff and sediment yield were not so meaningful since they failed to show any relationship with total rainfall.

The experiment was conducted in a 3 x 4 x 4 split-plot in randomized complete block design. The main plots were the fertilizer materials used, namely: inorganic fertilizer, earthworm castings and control (no fertilization). The subplots were the mulching materials such as, sugarcane bagasse, coconut coir dust and rice straw. Results  showed that the number of lateral vines per plant was significantly affected by the different fertilizer and mulch materials  used. Fertilization reduced the production of lateral vines. The highest number of 23 vines per plant, of which, was obtained from the unfertilized plants regardless of mulching materials used. Among the mulches, rice straw-mulched plants had the highest production of 28 lateral vines per plant. Rice straw mulch enhanced female flower production particularly so if earthworm castings were used as fertilizer. Regardless of fertilizer material used, rice straw-mulched plants produced significantly the highest percentage of the female flowers compared with the other mulches used. Regardless of mulches on the other hand, earthworm casting application produced significantly the highest percentage of female flowers compared with the rest of the materials used. Fruit deformities were highest among rice straw-mulched unfertilized plants similar with unmulched plants fertilized with inorganic fertilizer. The most number of fruits per plant was obtained from plants fertilized with inorganic fertilizer regardless of mulching materials used. On the other hand, plants mulched with sugarcane bagasse produced the most number of fruits regardless of fertilization. Fruit length and fruit diameter did not vary among the treatments used. This was probably because fruit length and diameter were stable varietal characteristics, which expectedly should not be affected by extraneous factors. The highest yield of 8.9 t/ha was obtained from plants fertilized with inorganic fertilizer and mulched with rice straw. The rest of the treatments had statistically comparable yields ranging from 5.8 to 7.6 t/ha. Soil properties, which included pH, organic matter content, N, P and K content, did not vary significantly with the different fertilizer materials applied. Despite the nonsignificant differences in yield, the numerical differences were reflected in the economic returns. The highest economic returns of P137,519.00/ha was computed from yield returns of plants applied with inorganic fertilizer and mulched with rice straw. Based on the findings, among the parameters measured, only the number of lateral vines production and the sex ratio of flowers produced were affected by the application of different fertilizer materials and mulches. Fruit length and diameter were considered stable characters, which were variety specific and did not respond to changes in such environmental factors as fertilizer or mulching materials applied. The number and weight of fruits per plant did not vary significantly among the treatments. Hence, the yield per hectare computed from the data did not also vary significantly. The numerical differences, however, brought about a substantial difference in the economic returns. Plant producing the most number and heaviest fruit gave the highest computed economic returns. The chosen study site apparently had relatively high fertility level. Hence, effects of fertilizer materials were not distinctly captured. With this, it was suggested that a similar study be conducted in soils with marginal fertility level to really check on the effect of the treatments used in this study without unnecessarily introducing a fertility bias. For sites, which are  relatively fertile, at least three continuous  cropping should be done to capture the desired effect of fertilizer and mulching materials used, the latter of which might still be decomposing at the termination of the study.

The values obtained were then used to determine the economic profitability of undertaking a soil conservation project, i.e., an agroforestry farm project. Data used on rate of sheet erosion in the area were obtained from MADECOR\'s 1982 study which estimated the average sheet erosion rate as 51.79 t/ha per year for the entire Magat watershed area. Sheet erosion losses were furthermore estimated as 30-40% of gross soil loss in the area. The on-site cost estimation revealed that a ton of soil contained P12.85 worth of inorganic fertilizers consisting of 2.3 kg urea, 0.80 kg superphosphate and 0.56 kg muriate of potash, all valued using the 1985 price level. For the entire watershed, sheeet erosion losses could cause an annual depletion of P274.38 M worth of inorganic fertilizers consisting of P181.5 M worth of urea, P42.70 M worth of super phosphate and P50.18 M worth of muriate of potash. A ton of sediment on the other hand, could cause a lost of P0.41 worth of irrigation and power benefits. Given a sedimentation rate of 345 t/ha per year for the entire watershed of 412,303 ha and assuming a trap efficiency of 93% then the yearly sedimentation losses amounted to P5.42 M. On a per hectare basis, off-site damage cost was estimated as P13.15. The estimated value of damages associated with erosion and sedimentation was then revalued using shadow prices of relevant inputs and output and incorporated in the economic analysis of a soil conservation measure like an agroforestry farm project. Results of the analysis showed that from the society\'s point of view, an average of 3.5 ha agroforestry farm project could earn a NPV of P431,485.58 over 20 years of operation using a discount rate of 12%.

These cultures consisted of actinomycetes, bacteria, and fungi. Of this number, 14 isolates were found highly antagonistic against the plant pathogen Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn, but only three were finally selected: an actinomycete, AN-756, a bacterium, ANB-767; and a fungus, ANF-777, for showing exceptionally strong inhibitory effect against R. solani but with no antagonistic action against the root nodule bacterium of legume, Rhizobium sp. Strain M5. In streak and counter-streak cultures on sterile agar media, the selected antagonists inhibited the growth of R. solani significantly. Likewise, using soil as the medium and mungbean as test plant, appreciable decrease in damping-off infection caused by R. solani was noted upon inoculation of the antagonists either singly or in combination of  cultures. The most promising microbial antagonist of R. solani was the fungus, ANF-777, which lowered damping-off incidence to 40.67% upon inoculation of active cultures on Rhizoctonia-infested soil. Grown separately in submerged fermentation, the antagonists produced active substances or antiobiotics that induced clear zones of inhibition against the assay organism in the assay plates. The antibiotic produced by the fungal antagonist ANF-777 in the brew was readily extracted by benzene, butanol, ethyl acetate and diethyl ether.

Each growing period was considered as a stage in a serial system in which a decision had to be made. A discrete time, discrete state dynamic programming (D.P.)  model, was developed to solve the aforementioned problems simultaneously. A solution was achieved through an appropriate computer program written in APL (A Programming Language). In the absence of a more appropriate growth model, a growth prediction equation based on secondary data was generated through a stepwise multiple regression analysis. The growth model was incorporated into the computer program, and it was used to predict stand growth for any stage, given an alternative residual volume and an average site productivity. Stumpage prices and stumpage production costs were calculated based on the economic data provided by the Nasipit Lumber Co. field office. These values were likewise incorporated into the program and later used in the computations of stage returns. The computer program was run at the Agricultural Resources Center (ARC) using the IBM 370/135 system. An optimal thinning schedule, indicating whether or not to thin and how much to thin (if even it is indicated) at any stage, was determined for each size of N, when N was the total number of stages. An overall optimal thinning schedule and a corresponding optimal rotation were simultaneously determined, given the basic assumptions of the D.P. model, for 14 and 10% interest rates. With 14% interest rate the maximum land expectation value (actually, the least negative) was equivalent to -P602.42/ha, and this fell under a seven-stage system. The optimal thinning schedule associated with this \"optimal\" rotation consisted of the following prescriptions: stage 1, no thinning; stage 2, 40% thinning; stage 3, 50% thinning; stage 4, 60% thinning; stage 5, no thinning; stage 6, 80% thinning; and 100% thinning or clear-cut for the final stage. The optimal rotation for 10% interest rate was five-stage or ten-year rotation with a maximum land expectation value equivalent to P199.57/ha. The associated optimal thinning schedule prescribed no thinning during the first two stages; 50% at stage 3; 60% at stage 4; and a clear-cut at stage 5. Land expectation values were significantly affected by the interest rate.

Estimates of variance components showed that the greatest contribution to the total variance was due to variation among fruits. Results showed that several combinations of trees and fruits per tree could be used for a certain level of precision and degree of confidence. A combination was considered optimum if the cost of handling the samples was least relative to other possible combinations. By looking at the relationship between the number of fruits and the corresponding coefficient of variation of the mean, sampling six to ten mature fruits from 2 to 46 trees at the 0.05 y precision level was considered optimum for a given character measured.  At the least-stringent precision level of 0.20 y at least one tree and eight fruits per tree would provide precise estimates of the means for any character studied. Stratification of carabao mango trees may be ignored when sampling for most of the characters measured in this study except skin weight and total soluble solids. Except for these two characters, the fruits samples could be chosen randomly from any portion of the tree. However, for characters where prior stratification is not recommended, the use of simple random sampling will result in a slight increase in the variance of the mean of any character; thus, a slightly larger sample size is required to meet the desired precision specially when using the 0.025 y level.

Four rice-based cropping schemes such as:  sorjan cropping scheme, continuous forage cropping, sequential and relay croppings were apportioned into a 5831 sq m irrigated area. The data from two heads of livestock were used as bases for the evaluation of the technical and economic feasibility of integrating livestock production in each cropping scheme. Of the four cropping schemes, \"sorjan\" produced the highest fodder yield at 20,205.20 kg dry matter/ha per year. It also outyielded all the three cropping schemes in terms of food and grain yield. The high crude protein (CP) of legumes made the continuous legume cropping pattern the highest CP yielder at 1437 kg/ha even if it was the lowest dry matter producer. On the other hand, the \"sorjan\" scheme produced the highest amount of food and feed calorie value. The \"sorjan\" scheme had the highest profit at P25,455.95/ha per year. Continuous rice production was the most expensive and the least profitable with a net return of only P2,624.70/ha per year. The dry matter yield per hectare of \"sorjan\" scheme supported 11 heads of carabao reared for 257 days or 29 heads of cattle with a turn over frequency of three months. The continuous forage cropping scheme had the least carrying capacity with excess CP yield. Economic evaluation of the integrated system, including waste recycling, showed a net return of P43,253.73/ha per year and P77,094.15/ha per year could be obtained using carabao and cattle, respectively. The results indicated that the four cropping schemes could be adopted in a unit of land to provide animals with nutritious and balanced feed material the whole year round as well as carbohydrates and protein materials for human consumption.

Descriptive statistics and measures of variability were used in the analysis and interpretation of data. The 350 respondents, aged 20-88 years old, mostly married and elementary graduates, had been raising pigs for 17.48 years, with a farming experience of nearly 20 years. The native pig raisers were generally poor and their means of livelihood was basically crop-based farming system with livestock integration as secondary source of income. This crop-livestock production system was a cooperative endeavor between husbands and housewives. The average farm size of the respondents was located mostly in the upland areas and usually planted to rice and corn intercropped with legumes and rootcrops. More than 40% of the total respondents were owner-cultivators and more than 25% were amortizing owners or CLT holders. Most of them belonged to two major income levels of P6,001-10,000 and P10,001-15,000 annual gross income. The respondents consumed pork at least once a month which was bought from the market. Breeding stocks were obtained from neighbors and seldom from the raiser\'s own herd. Many owned the pigs being raised while others practiced the so-called shared and combined system of ownership. Lack of feeds and water resources and veterinary services were among the most important problems perceived by the native pig raisers. Pigs were commonly fed twice daily with either rice or corn bran mixed with farm by-products in troughs made from local materials. Gilts were usually bred at around eight to ten months of age on the second day of estrus using a neighbors\' boar. The service boar is paid with one piglet per litter sired. Boars and sows were used for breeding purposes for two to three years. Most farmer-respondents provided for the following management practices in raising native pigs: maintained cleanliness and sanitation; sprinkled or bathed pregnant animals during hot weather months; removed fetal membrane of newly-born piglets; dewormed and castrated male piglets not intended for breeding; practiced feeding of soilage crops and salt supplementation; and practiced self-treatment of sick pigs with commercial veterinary drugs and seldom consulted veterinarians not only due to financial constraints but also due to scarcity of veterinaray services in the locality. Farmers kept pigs under their houses and granaries and practiced tethering of pigs under trees. The reproductive and productive performance of native pigs were as follows: gestation period - 115.62 days; age at first mating - 7.84 months; age at first farrowing - 11.73 months; and estrous cycle - 20.50 days. Heat period lasted for 3.29 days with farrowing interval of 208.24 days. Litter size at birth was 8.12 pigs and litter size at weaning was 6.86 pigs. Age of weaning was 60 days. Age at puberty in males was 6.52 months while sexual maturity in female native pigs occurred at 7.11 months of age. The most prevalent coat color of native pigs was black. Coat color pattern varied from pure black to spotted black and white. However, striped coat color pattern with dark brown and red spots mixture were also commonly observed among native pigs. Most native pig had long snout, dish-like or concave face shapes; erect and medium-size ears; short bodylength; and medium tail length. Absence of tusks in most native boars was likewise observed.

Physiographic factors included aspect, elevation, plot position and slope or gradient; climatic factors were annual rainfall, relative humidity, temperature and number of rainy days; and soil chemical and physical properties were nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium, organic mater, pH, base saturation, cation exchange capacity, water-holding capacity, soil depth and soil texture. The climatic factors obtained significant correlations with some tree growth parameters such as diameter at breast height, merchantable height, basal area, volume and site index indicating that growth of yemane plantations was significantly affected by these factors. However, only rainfall had positive correlations. Temperature and relative humidity were inversely related to tree growth. Comparatively, inverse relationships between tree growth parameters and all physiographic variables were obtained. This implied that steeper slopes, from lower to upper slopes and ridgetops and from lower to upper elevations, might result in a concommitant decrease in growth or site quality of yemane plantations. Analysis of soil chemical and physical properties showed that calcium content of soil, base saturation, soil depth, magnesium, cation exchange capacity, sodium and clay content of soil were all significant explanatory variables for estimating or predicting growth and site index of yemane plantations.

Each lysimeter tank was planted to cotton to determine the water consumptive use of the crop as influenced by the application of rice straw mulch on three tanks, rice hull mulch on another three tanks, and three tanks that were unmulched. In this study, better yields of cotton were obtained when rice straw mulch was applied during the medium or late planting dates when soil moisture content for crops were critical. The application of rice straw mulch at a thickness of 4-5 cm gave a mean plant height of 88.89 cm and mean number of bolls of 8.33. For the completed growing season, the mean daily water consumption of the crop were 3.92 mm, 4.49 mm, and 5.65 mm for plant with rice straw mulch, rice hull mulch and without mulch, respectively.

While the furrow and mixed ipil-ipil leaves placement methods did not differ significantly on the weight of maize marketable ears, these methods were comparably better than the mulch. The ipil-ipil leaves placement methods did not differ significantly on their effects on the soil pH and on the growth and yield characters of maize, which include percent N of maize stover and grain. Plant heights, percent N of maize stover, grain, barren stalk and percent unfilled ears as influenced by variety and time of ipil-ipil leaves applications did not vary significantly. However, in terms of total dry matter yield and weight of marketable ears, the results obtained from plants applied with ipil-ipil leaves at planting time were comparable with those taken from plants applied with ammonium sulfate at the time of planting and hilling-up. UPCA Var. #1 and Philippine composite DMR #1 differed significantly on the number of days to silking stage, which may be due to the early maturity characteristics of Philippine Composite DMR #1. Other marked differences were on percent unfilled ears and barren stalks, grain yield, dry matter yield, percent N of maize stover and grain, which apparently attributed to the nitrogen received by the maize plants. Higher incidents of unfilled ears and barren stalks were observed on unfertilized plants and on plants that received 90 kg N/ha. Likewise, these less fertilized plants gave relatively lower grain yield, dry matter yield and percent N of maize stover and grain. On ipil-ipil leaves decomposition, higher percentages of ammonia N and available P (ppm) were under 25% available soil moisture (25% ASM), while exchangeable K was not significantly affected by different soil moisture. Moreover, the peak of ammonia-N release from the decomposition of ipil-ipil leaves was noted during the third week after placement and drastically declined after. The slight increase of P (ppm) in the soil, which might be attributed to the decomposing ipil-ipil leaves, was observed during the first week after placement.

These were: 1) screening of ramie varieties for fiber fineness, 2) study on the phenology and fiber development in ramie and 3) effect of different fertilizer levels and harvest stages on yield and fineness of three ramie varieties. Fiber morphological measurements (fiber diameter, lumen width and cell wall thickness) were used to evaluate fiber fineness of 27 ramie varieties. Based on fiber diameter measurements, the 27 ramie varieties were grouped into fine, intermediate and coarse fibers. Consequently, the following varieties were used as entries for Experiments 2 and 3. Shiraginu was selected as a fine fiber variety, Miyasaki 112 as intermediate and San Miguel as coarse fiber variety. The phenological events studied in Experiment 2 were: number of days to flowering, number of days to browning of flowers and number of days to browning of stalks behaved differently among varieites and between seasons except the number of days to flowering. San Miguel and Shiraginu flowered early; their stalks and flowers turned brown earlier compared to Miyasaki 112. Moreover, all varieties matured earlier during the dry season compared with the wet season. Fiber diameter increased with growth stages during the wet season and decreased during the dry season. Cell wall thickness increased while lumen width decreased with growth stages in both dry and wet seasons. What was interesting was that lumen width appeared to decrease at about the same time that cell wall thickness started to sharply increase 40 days after ratooning (DAR). The correlation analysis in Experiment 1 showed that lumen width was highly associated with fiber diameter. These observations plus the easiness in which lumen width can be measured were good indications of the use of lumen width as a better method of characterizing fiber vineness at 40 DAR over fiber diameter and cell wall thickness. The sampling time was best done 40 DAR. The field study showed that higher fertilizer levels and appropriate harvest stage improved total dry fiber yield and quality of ramie. Substantial yield can be attained using  F-3 (10 t ramie wates plus 45-30-30 kg/ha of N, P2O5 and K2O) and when harvested at 40 DAR. Although fertilizer levels had very little influence on fiber fineness, plants harvested 40 DAR produced fiber cells with thinner lumen width, a characteristic of fine fibers. The results suggested that for soils similar to Maahas clay loam, the application of 10 t ramie wastes plus addition of 45-30-30 kg/ha of N, P2O5 and K2O and harvesting at 40 DAR would produce a respectable dry fiber yield with acceptable fiber fineness.',NULL,NULL,'Ontok, Omanan G.','FOLK MEDIA, ETHNIC GROUPS, DIFFUSION OF INFORMATION, INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE, Communications',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2713,'2021-09-01 07:44:50','2021-09-01 07:44:50','The growth and yield of sweet potato and sorghum intercrop as influenced by time overlap and levels of nitrogen fertilization.','1983-09-01','The field experiment was conducted at the Camarines Sur Agricultural College experimental area devoted to root crops production from the later part of the crop year 1979 to early 1980. It determined the effect of planting sequence and nitrogen fertilization on sweet potato intercropped with sorghum. Three plant sequences on intercropping (PS1: sorghum and sweet potato planted at the  same  time, PS2:  sweet potato planted ahead of sorghum, PS3: sweet potato planted 15 days later than sorghum) were used. Four nitrogen levels (zero levels, N2: 0-0-30, N1: 50-0-30, and high levels, N2: 100-0-30, N2: 100-0-30, N3: 150-0-30) were applied. The split plot design with four replications was used. The nitrogen fertilizer levels served as the main plot and the planting sequence and crop combination as subplot. The number of tip, vine and root yields of sweet potato were not affected by planting sequence and levels of nitrogen fertilization. The height of sorghum was reduced when planted as an intercrop in later stage of growth, which indicated that it was not necessarily affected by the changing levels of nitrogen fertilization and planting sequence. The increased levels of nitrogen fertilization resulted in a higher dry matter yield with 50 kg N/ha as the best. Sorghum monoculture exhibited a higher dry matter yield and better height than when planted with sweet potato. Sweet potato roots responded better to moisture content, when fertilized with higher levels of nitrogen. However, starch content and B-carotene of the roots indicated a higher response at an optimum level of 50 kg N/ha. No significant effect on planting sequence was found. Sweet potato monoculture obtained a higher percentage of starch content over the intercrop. A decrease in the starch content was noted with higher levels of N application. A similar trend of decrease in B-carotene content was observed with the application of 100 kg N/ha. The grain yield of sorghum was not affected by the increased rates of N application. The relative productivity of the intercrop was higher than the monoculture. It was noted that the land equivalent ratio (LER) responded better at higher levels of N application.

Nitrogen fertilization and intercropping are two methods of increasing the productivity of upland rice. Two field experiments were conducted to determine the physiological and agronomic response of five upland rice to different levels of nitrogen fertilization; evaluate the effects of legume intercropped at different row proportions on yield, growth and development of upland rice; and evaluate agronomic advantages of upland rice + legume intercropping over rice monoculture. The first experiment was laid out on a 4 x 5 split plot arrangement in RCB design with three replications. The mainplots were composed of four levels of nitrogen (0, 40, 80 and 120 kg N ha-1) and the subplots were composed of five upland rice varieties (UPL Ri 7, Malidu, Azucena, Hinamot and Bihod). In the second experiment, Malidu was intercropped with mungbean and pigeonpea at 4:2 and 2:2 row proportions. The treatments were laid out on RCB design with three replications. Application of N fertilizer increased leaf area index, leaf area duration, total dry matter yield, length of panicle, number of filled grains per panicle, number of panicle per square meter and grain yield per hectare of upland rice. Harvest index, however, declined with N fertilization. The five upland rice varieties varied significantly in terms of total DMY at harvest, number of days from sowing to heading and to maturity, length of panicle, plant height, yield  components and grain yield. UPL  Ri7 had the highest yield. Among the traditional varieties, Malidu and Hinamot had significantly higher grain yield than Azucena and Bihod. UPL Ri7 responded positively to the application of 120 kg N ha-1 while the traditional varieties responded well to 40 kg N ha-1. Intercropping upland rice with legumes significantly decreased net assimilation rate, crop growth rate, dry matter accumulation, plant height, length of panicle, harvest index and grain  yield. On the other hand, upland rice intercrop did not significantly influence the physiological characters and yield components of intercropped mungbean and pigeonpea. Significant differences between the monocrop and intecropped legumes were, however, observed in terms of absolute grain yield. Intercrop treatments obtained higher combined LAI two weeks earlier than the monocultures. The intercrops also gave higher yields per unit land area than the sole crop.

Ash-free dry weight, count of organisms, plant pigment concentration and caloric content were used as a measure of lab-lab quantity while ash, protein, lipid and cellulose content were used as a measure of lab-lab quality. Soil differences between strata did not always affect the quantity or quality of lab-lab so that pond stratification was not necessary when sampling lab-lab, except perhaps when soil differences were extremely great. Accumulation of floating lab-lab on one side of the pond as an effect of the wind might cause complications in sampling. Removal of these accumulated lab-lab was found advantageous. Except for lipid content, marked differences in quantity and quality were observed between floating and attached lab-lab. Floating lab-lab showed a much lower degree of degradation and had a significantly higher number of organisms, chlorophyll concentration, caloric content, protein and cellulose content than attached lab-lab, which were associated with its lower ash content.

Analyses of variances showed that genotypic variations were present in all the characters. Further analysis of genotypic variances revealed that dominance effects were important for seed yield, number of pods, 100-seed weight, number of seeds per pod and days to maturity. Additive generic effects contributed significantly to pod length while both additive and nonadditive gene effects were responsible for the inheritance of flowering period. Heritability estimates in the broad sense for each character were as follows: 55.50% for seed yield. 43.23% for pod length; 78.66% for number of pods per plant; 51.00% for 100-seed weight; 33.24% for seed number per pod; 66.96% for flowering period; and 35.34 for maturity period.

The higher values of nonadditive genetic variances relative to additive genetic variances could be caused by the presence of epistasis aside from dominance. For seed yield and number of pods, the coefficients of variations were high, which might be attributed to small plot size, absence of guard rows and the way the experimental area was blocked.

Comparative efficiency analyses of the different sampling methods and specifications were made based on accuracy, precision, and cost of field measurements. The criterion suggested by Grosenbaugh and Mesavage in 1956 was also used as an additional measure of efficiency. Statistically, all point sampling factor specifications gave nonsignificantly different results. The same finding was obtained in the case of the various 3Pee sampling specifications tested.

Four irrigation treatments were made: 0, 50, 300, and 600 gal water/tree. Trees were irrigated at ten days after budbreak and at weekly intervals thereafter until 48 days after full bloom. Irrigation significantly increased the number of fruits per panicle. At harvest, trees receiving 0 and 150 gal of water had an average of 0.4 fruit while those irrigated with 300 and 600 gal of water produced 1.0 and 1.4 fruits per panicle, respectively. The growth of \'carabao\' mango fruits followed a single sigmoid curve, irrespective of the irrigation treatments applied. The increases in fresh weight, dry matter, length, thickness and width of fruits were consistently of greater magnitude in trees irrigated with 150 and 300 gal of water and relatively lower in 600 gal treated trees. The differences were attributed to the differences in the number of fruits obtained in these treatments. The concentration of N, P, K and  Mg generally decreased with increasing stages of fruit development. The reductions were attributed to dilution effect as a result of growth with the uptake of these elements. K, N and Ca were needed in large amounts by developing fruits. The need for Mg and P was comparatively small. Irrigation significantly increased N, K, Ca, Fe, Mn and Zn but did not significantly affect Mg and P concentrations to fruits. In the leaves, only Ca and Zn were significantly affected by irrigation treatments. The trees irrigated with 300 gal of water consistently showed higher amount of the nutrient elements. The differences in the concentrations of these elements at varying moisture conditions in the soil were explained by the number of fruits present in the tree, the relative availability of the elements at a given level of soil moisture, and/or the combinations of both. The total N, P and K removed from a mango tree irrigated with 300 gal of water were about 320, 150 and 3075 g, respectively. Thus, the recommended fertilizer rate of 2.5 kg/tree of 14-14-14 was sufficient for N and P but deficient in K. Irrigation increased the level of auxin- and gibberellin-like substances.

No significant difference was observed in the phytoplankton production among the three frequency levels and no interaction between rates and frequency of application for phytoplankton production existed. Green algae were the dominant forms among the phytoplankton observed. Zooplankton production increased linearly up to 0.40 g/L of fermented pig manure application and lowered at 0.80 g/L in any frequency level. Significant growth was obtained at the rates of 0.40, 0.20 and 0.10 g/L of manure. Significant production was observed at the daily application but only at the rate of 0.40 g/L. There was no interaction between rates and frequency for zooplankton production. Phytoplankton production was not correlated with zooplankton. Rotifers were the dominant zooplankton observed. In Experiment II, higher survival, weight gain and fish production were attained in treatment III than in the other two treatments.

Microenvironment parameters such as dew formation and its rate of loss during the day, incident light penetration and reflection within the plant canopy, air temperature at different locations in the canopy, pattern of moisture depletion and soil temperature were used to explain the growth behavior of garlic, cotton and tobacco under different cropping systems. Crop water use efficiency was based on the economic yield of the crops produced per unit of irrigation water. Mulching enhanced the formation of adventitious roots in tobacco, which significantly increased the number of roots of this crop at a depth of 0-10 cm while intercropping garlic promoted the formation of deeper roots in cotton. Roots of cotton were concentrated at a depth of 31-50 cm while that of garlic intercrop were at 11-30 cm. A 10-cm mulch and 15-cm irrigation were noted to stabilize soil temperature particularly in the upper 0-10 cm of the soil. Among the cropping systems, tobacco + garlic had the most stable temperature while the monoculture garlic had the least control of its environment. Mulching was more effective in moisture conservation at low irrigation rates. Mulch thickness did not influence the total amount of daily dew formation, although the 5- and 10-cm mulch were higher than the unmulched soil. The rate of evaporation of the dew formed, however, more stable in the 10-cm mulch, with the bare soil more easily lost. More dew was formed in the monoculture garlic but it was readily evaporated compared to those in the 150-cm rows of cotton or tobacco. A 100-cm row space of either cotton or tobacco greatly reduced light penetration, which deprived the garlic intercrop of its light needs. The 150-cm row space was ideal for cotton while the 200-cm was best for tobacco when garlic was intercropped to these plants. Significantly, more light was reflected by the mulched treatments. Mulch thickness, however, did not affect the quantity of light reflected. Higher amount of reflected light was noted in the monoculture garlic particularly in the later part of the growth period.',NULL,NULL,'Pelea, Nimfa R.','FISH PRODUCTS, MICROBIOLOGY, Food science and technology',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2739,'2021-09-01 07:44:50','2021-09-01 07:44:50','Row spacing and irrigation for mungo (Vigna radiata (L.)

Plant growth parameters such as height, leaf area, root length, number of developed pods per plant and number of developed seeds per pod were evaluated. The photosynthetic capacity of the plant was estimated by determining the total dry matter produced, seed size and bean yield per hectare. Water use efficiency was evaluated in terms of the seed produced per unit of irrigation water applied in the field. Plants that were spaced closer in the row grew taller, had greater leaf area index and relatively longer roots, but they had the disadvantage of wider top-root ratio. Closer row spacing gave higher seed yield in the December-March crop because of longer pods, more seeds per pod and bigger seeds. Significantly better water use efficiency was also observed in closer row spacing. The plant characters studied including seed and dry matter yield improved as the amount of irrigation increased. However, water use efficiency decreased with an increase in the amount of irrigation. Irrigation done at two-three trifoliate leaf stage and full bloom substantially increased seed and dry matter yield because of greater leaf area index and root volume, longer pods, more pods per plant and greater number of developed seeds per pod. Irrigation at pod-filling stage improved seed size but the number of pods per plant and seeds per pod were more deterministic; hence, greater yields were obtained in T1 than in T2. Water use efficiency was also better in T1 especially in drier conditions. On the overall interaction of the factors studied, the highest seed and dry matter yields were obtained in S1L3T1.

MRS-3 was studied to characterize the morpho-histological changes in the axillary bud prior to and on the imposition of apical dominance by the apex or by exogenously applied phyto-hormones (IAA and ABA) after decapitation. The bud inhibited by other synthetic growth regulants, which are potential tobacco sucker control chemicals, was also described. The tobacco axillary bud elongated up to 3-4 mm with 10-11 subtending leaves before it was totally inhibited by the shoot apex. At inhibition, procambial strands were continuous from the bud to the main stele. The cells at the apex of the inhibited bud were quiescent. Within one week after decapitation, the axillary bud was released from apical dominance. Consequently, the stem elongated, more leaves were initiated, and cell division occurred. A higher degree of secondary vascularization in the bud stele and the junction between the bud stele and the main stele were also attained. Treatment of the decapitated stem with 500 to 10,00 ppm IAA preserved the status of the inhibited axillary bud. The application of 50-100 ppm ABA did not inhibit the bud. Results indicated that IAA in situ and that exogenously applied after decapitation could inhibit axillary bud growth of tobacco. It did not, however, inhibit bud growth primarily through prevention of vascularization. It was also unlikely that ABA coming from the apex of mature leaves played a role in axillary bud inhibition. The more likely alternative was that the inhibition was the effect of a certain balance between auxin and another substance, which might come from the roots, the stem or the bud itself. Despite the inhibitory effect of IAA on axillary bud growth, it was not suitable for sucker control in tobacco because exogenously applied IAA was metabolized. The use of synthetic auxins like 3,6 dichloropicolinic acid at 9.37 mg ai/plant and inhibitors of cell division activity like pendimethalin at 18.75 mg ai/plant appeared more promising. These levels inhibited axillary bud growth without injury to developed leaves fully, when applied as directed sprays on the stems of decapitated plants.

Thirty-two plots of 5 x 5 m were established. Real growth series (initial and two remeasurement periods) and abstract time series data (three study areas with five, two and one stand ages expressed in years after harvest during the initial measurement) for height, diameter, and density of natural Benguet pine regenerations were collected from these plots. Vegetation analysis (harvest method) of plant species growing with the natural Benguet pine regenerations was conducted during and at the onset of the rainy season in the different study areas, including the Patteng area where the Benguet pines were not harvested. Physiographic information, data on mother trees, light intensity, soil depth and soil sampling for textural and chemical analysis were collected once, while soil sampling for moisture content determination was done at monthly intervals. Likewise, rainfall was monitored daily in Lamunan for 45 days. Result of the stepwise regression procedure showed that 84.00% of the variation in density of natural Benguet pine regeneration was caused by variation in air temperature, rainfall, elevation, soil nitrogen, soil texture (clay and sand fraction), soil depth of A horizon and soil moisture. About 50.00% of the variation in density was caused by air temperature, rainfall and elevation. About 86.78% of the variation in height of natural Benguet pine regeneration was caused by variation in clay content, soil depth, air temperature, soil pH, soil nitrogen and phosphorus, sand content of soil, soil moisture, rainfall and light intensity. Clay content, soil depth of A horizon and air temperature accounted 54% of the variation in height of regenerations.

The materials used were obtained from the otter trawl catches of the R/V ALBACORE in the Visayan Sea from June 1976 to March 1977. The study of 1,114 scallops showed that A. pleuronectes was a hermaphrodite and it had five stages of gonadal condition which were grouped into three general stages (immature, mature, spent), because of considerable overlap which occurred between stages. The spawning period of the species was protracted; intense spawning occurred in December through February, with the peak of intense spawning in January; minor spawning peaks occurred in June and October. The species reached sexual maturity at a shell height of about 54 mm. Examinations of the stomach contents of 100 scallop specimens, with sizes varying from 21 mm to 91 mm, showed that their food consisted of diatoms, dinoflagellates, sand particles, tintinnids, sponge spicules, molluscan larvae, foraminiferans, crustacean holoplankton and larvae, radiolarians, silicoflagellates, echinoderm larvae, nemertineans and unidentified detritus.

The study examined the production flow of PCARRD\'s seven publications chosen from its 13 publication lines. A sample publication was chosen from each line except in Technology Series, where two sample publications were included in the study to compare the production costs and problems of publications printed in-house from those that were printed by private printers. This made a total of eight publications included in the study, namely, Philippine Recommends for Coconut Timber Utilization, PCARRD Monitor Vol. 13 No. 9, Scientia Filipinas Vol. 2 No. 2, State of the Art Rice Marketing, Book Series on Lesser Used Fiber Crops, Research Highlights 1984, and two volumes of Technology! (Integrated Fish-pig Farming and Rubber  Intercropping). The eight publications were chosen from among those that came out regularly and regardless of budget resources for printing during the start of the study. Data for production time was based on interviews with the directors of PCARRD, the subject matter specialists, editors, typists, artist, photographers and all those involved in the production of publications. The study was conducted through listing the production process for each publication studied. The inclusive dates the staff worked on the manuscript from editing until the final copy was recorded by monitoring the status of the publications every other day. Total production time for personnel services was the number of days the manuscript stayed with the staff while actual production time referred to the number of days the staff actually worked on the manuscript. Cost for total and actual production time were computed by dividing the monthly salary of the staff with an average of 22 working days and multiplied by the number of days of total and actual production work. Printing costs of the publications were retrieved from letter orders kept at the ACD file. Costs for supplies and materials for some of the publications were retrieved from vouchers kept at the Auditor\'s office. Other data were retrieved from annual reports, PCARRD plantilla, budget allocations and obligations and travel orders. Results showed that the Philippines Recommends for Coconut Timber Utilization could be produced in 225 days with an actual production time of 134 days. Scientia Filipinas was produced in 315 days and an actual production time of 186 days, Book Series on Lesser Used Fiber Crops in 233 days with an actual production time of 126 days, State of the Art Rice Marketing for a total of 405 days and an actual time of 161 days, Research Highlights for 247 days and an actual time of 122 days, PCARRD Monitor for a total of 47 days and actual time of 39 days, and the Technology Series had a total production time of 98 days for the Integrated Fish-Pig Farming and 76 days for the Rubber Intercropping. Actual production time for the latter was 38.5 days while the former was 29 days. By and large, the data indicated that production time could be as long as 405 days and as short as 47 days depending on the thickness of the publication. But most of the time, other factors such as production time and financial problem in printing should also be looked into. The study showed that more time were spent in the preparation of the manuscripts than during actual production work. Results also showed that if production process was delayed in one stage, everybody had to double time in the succeeding production stages. With this kind of arrangement, however, quality of the publication usually suffered when production was rushed. Nevertheless, publication costs could have been a lot higher when operations costs were included in the  printing costs. Data also showed that it would be cheaper if publications were printed by private printers rather than when printed in-house. Besides, less problems were met with publications printed by private printers. The absence of supplies and materials when they were most needed also delayed production time. Four alternative costing procedures could be developed in printing PCARRD publications. First, costs could be assigned on the basis of the actual staff time spent in each publication. Second, costs could be assigned proportional to the allocated budget for each publication. Third, lump all together staff and plant costs into \"overhead costs\" and assign equal portion of this overhead cost to each publication.

Various postharvest treatments were studied to control Fusarium tuber rot. Different combinations of fungicidal treatment and storage temperature were tested. Benlate, Captan, Daconil, Dithane M-45 and Zineb were used as dips at different concentrations for two minutes. The temperatures tested were 5-30?C at five-degree interval and ambient room temperature. Potato tubers were treated with the fungicide either 24 or 48 hours after inoculation then stored at a specific temperature. Results showed that Fusarium tuber rot could be controlled at 5?C for a week provided that the tubers were stored at this temperature 24 hours after inoculation. The disease was not controlled when the tubers were stored at 5?C for 48 hours after inoculation. All other temperatures did not prevent the development of rotting.

Eighty-four percent of the respondents were rice technicians, nine percent were livestock technicians and seven percent were fisheries technicians. Of the respondents, 66% were B.S. Agriculture graduates, 20% were B.S. Agricultural Education and Agricultural Extension graduates, 11% were undergraduates and 3% were high school or vocational school graduates. The greatest number of respondents had agronomy as their major field of study followed by animal husbandry and education. Fifty-four percent worked in extension for less than five years and the rest for five or more years. On knowledge of the technology presented in The Philippines Recommends, about equal proportions of the respondents were low and high scorers in rice techology. On the other hand, nearly all had low knowledge of both beefcattle and bangus technology. Respondents had a relatively favorable attitude to the technology presented in The Philippines Recommends. A majority of the respondents had favorable attitude in all of the three commodities studied. As to use of the technology in extension work, there were considerably more high users (79%) than low users as far as rice technology was concerned. The opposite was observed for use of beefcattle and bangus technology in which low users constituted 79 and 83%, respectively. The respondents\' knowledge of technology reported in The Philippines Recommends for rice, beefcattle aand bangus was significantly associated with commodity specialization, or whether the respondents were rice, livestock or fisheries technicians.

The survey covered a total of 25 beef cattle ranches classified as small (nine), medium (eight) and large (eight) based on animal unit (AU). On the average, the small ranches had 107 AU, medium ranches had 268 AU, and large ranches had 798 AU. All ranches averaged 380 AU. Total pasture area per ranch was estimated at 639 ha; 93% of the area was open grasslands, 6.7% improved pasture and 0.3% brushlands. Stocking rates were 0.66, 0.70 and 0.79 AU/ha for small, medium and large ranches, respectively. Percentage calf drop was 46.2, 38.2 and 44.2 for the three sizes of ranches, respectively, with a mean of 43.2 for all. Calf mortality was highest in small (8.1%) and lowest in large (5.4%) and 7.4% for the medium ranches and an overall mean of 6.5%. However, in mature cattle mortality, the large ranches had the highest rate of 4.68% as compared to 2.86% for the small and 3.75% for the medium ones. The different ranch sizes obtained varied net returns. Net return in large ranches was P524,110.00 or 6.5 times more than that of the small ranches (P79,380.00) and four times more than that of the medium ranches (P122,230.00). On a per hectare basis, net returns were P514.00, P177.00 and P314.00 for the large, medium and small ranches, respectively.

Four scientists, 5 technicians/extension workers and 26 farmer-users were interviewed. Snow-baling method was used to identify the respondents. Aside from interviews, secondary data from published and unpublished literature were also analyzed. The farmer-cooperators in Laguna and Rizal were involved because of lack of experimental animals. Thus, AIBT was brought to the farmer\'s field. Fortunately, the results at the farmer\'s field were encouraging, favoring the adoption of AIBT by the neighboring towns of Laguna and Quezon. The study found that the different government organizations significantly helped in the development and adoption of the technology. The study also found that interpersonal networks even without the use of communication materials significantly stirred the adoption of the technology. The technology brought about the following consequences: 1) increase in the population of carabaos in Laguna and Quezon; 2) increase in the quality of genetic make-up among our carabaos; 3) provided members of the research community, particularly the PCRDC staff the chance to travel and study abroad to upgrade skills for carabao research and development; and 4) exposure for further learning for extension workers of the Department of Agriculture. The study showed that the immediate adoption of AIBT was facilitated by: 1) attributes of the technology; 2) the active role the organizations played in developing and diffusing the technology; 3) the role the local top officials (from governors to barangay captains) played in diffusing technology; 4) the high level of interest among the users of the technology; and 5) the interplay of the above factors.

Differences in solid phase density, bulk density, total porosity, pore-size distribution and aggregation were observed among the various layers of each soil profile and among soils. Six soils, namely, Libmanan, Salvacion-a, Salvacion-b, Baao, Palestina, and San Roque were clayey throughout the profile, with clay contents of 69-82% for Libmanan and 40-68% for the other five soils. The Ligao and Libon soils, on the other hand, were sandy loam to loam and silty clay loam to silty clay, respectively. Differences in detailed particle-size distribution existed both within and among soils. Except the Ligao soil, all the soils were very well aggregated throughout the profile, with water-stable aggregates larger than 0.18 mm constituting well over 70% of the oven dry weight of the soil in practically all cases. The percent of the ultimate particles smaller than 0.18 mm that were present as aggregates larger than 0.18 mm, i.e., the percent aggregate stability, was well above 80 throughout the profile for all soils, including Ligao. Mean-weight and geometric mean diameter of water-stable aggregates were, in practically all cases, within the ranges of 2-6.5 and 1.2-5.4 mm, respectively, and decreased with increasing depth. All moisture release curves were very steep between 0 and 1/3-bar suctions and flattened off thereafter. The amounts of water released between 1/3- and 15-bar suctions were quite low and fell within the narrow range of 12-33% by volume of the soil. As much as 71-95% of such amounts was released between 1/3- and 5-bar suctions, indicating an easy release of most of the available water in these soils and a need for its frequent replenishment in upland-crop production. The only surface soil that exhibited little hysteresis in water retention in the suction range of 0-200 cm of water was Salvacion-a; otherwise, the hysteresis was quite appreciable even for sorption or desorption alone. Soil-water diffusivity and its relationship with water content were similar among repacked samples of the eight surface soils, with variations of about 13- to 216-fold over the water-content range of 21-70% by volume and about 3- to 5-fold for individual water contents within this range. Most semi-log relationships exhibited a peak diffusivity value near the upper end of the water-content range and a slight decreasing trend with increasing water content thereafter. The semi-log hydraulic conductivity-water content curves were essentially straight lines of very similar slopes over the entire water-content range, with variations of about 350- to 3,800-fold over a range of water content of 21-70%. Large variations in hydraulic conductivity at saturation were observed within and among soils and between the replicates of the same soil sample. The Ligao soil, however, exhibited quite uniform and large hydraulic conductivity at saturation throughout the profile.

Determination of this level was based on the density/damage and yield relationship, cost of control per unit area and the prevailing market price of the crop per unit of weight. Yield reduction was directly associated with the degree of damage that these plants were subjected to. The highest yield reduction was in plants with 100% defoliation and lowest at 25% leaf removal.

The Box-Cox, logarithmic and/or square-root transformations yielded adequate normal residual distributions for total production (Y5), total cost of labor (Y6), production per hectare (Y7), income from other sources (Y8) and amount of material input (Y9).

Physical, chemical, sensory and cost analyses of the samples were determined to identify the most reasonable utilization of a certain byproduct in a given meat specialty. The use of tripe in beef and carabeef loaves significantly decreased the values for cooking yield, cooking stability, water holding capacity (WHC), fat, protein, scores for color, flavor and general acceptability. On the other hand, the pH values, moisture content and juiciness, and tenderness scores of the products increased. The optimum level at which tripe could be incorporated in meat loaf processing without adverse effects on the final quality of the products was at 20% level. This resulted in lower cost of production. Between beef and carabeef tripe loaves, generally, carabeef had better physical and chemical characteristics and cheaper cost than beef although the latter had slightly better sensory characteristics. In liver sausage processing, use of carabeef livers resulted in significantly better processing characteristics and cheaper cost of production compared to beef and pork livers. The use of pork, beef and carabeef byproducts into headcheese was feasible because resulting products had good physical and chemical properties and sensory qualities. All products were acceptable.',NULL,NULL,'Raymundo, Reynaldo L.','IPOMOEA BATATAS, SWEET POTATOES, FETILIZER APPLICATION, PLANT RESPONSE, NUTRIENT UPTAKE, LIMING, NPK FERTILIZERS, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2766,'2021-09-01 07:44:50','2021-09-01 07:44:50','Vegetable in multiple cropping with corn allelopathy: effects on soil properties, crop performance and yield.','1983-09-01','Caffeic and coumaric acids were identified as the allelopathic substances in cowpea and bush sitao while ferulic and salicylic acids were detected in corn, cowpea, and pole sitao extract. Cowpea and bush sitao extracts were consistently found alllelopathic to corn in terms of seed germination and length of shoots and roots of seedlings under laboratory conditions.  None of the sequential crops tested had detrimental residual effects on the succeeding corn crop under field conditions. N applied either as ammonium sulfate or ipil-ipil leaves and crop sequential planting regardless of the crop sequence, increased N, P and K uptake of all the crops in the sequence. Sweet potato, cowpea and bush sitao significantly increased total N, P and K uptake of corn and vegetable crops. Gross or net returns in all cropping scheme were increased significantly by the sequential crop yields rather than by the base crop yields. On this basis, tomato and sweet potato were the best sequential crops for corn, followed by cabbage, bush sitao, cowpea and pole sitao. Intercropping did not alter most of the soil properties measured such as pH, OM and soil N, P and K contents. Likewise LAI (leaf area index) was not significantly altered. Light transmission or penetration increased with wider spatial row arrangement and was accompanied by a decrease in light interception of the base crop. However, the reduction in light interception of the base crop might be compensated by the light interception of the intercrops. All of the intercrops used provided greater net returns and land equivalent ratio (LER) values over the sole corn crop. The significant effects on LER values indicated that the combination of base crop and intercrops must have exploited the environmental resources more effectively than the pure stand. Corn + tomato was the most compatible base crop-intercrop combination; followed by corn + pole sitao, corn + sweet potato, and corn + chinese cabbage. Corn as base crop was a better competitor than vegetable intercrops although competition between them was minimal. Trellising of pole sitao, transplanting of tomato and chinese cabbage and the use of cuttings for sweet potato improved their competitiveness as measured by beta values, which enabled them to compete with corn for the environmental resources available.',NULL,NULL,'Razal, Ramon A.','DIPTEROCARPUS GRANDIFLORUS, PLANT EXTRACTS, CHEMICAL COMPOSITION, Forestry',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2767,'2021-09-01 07:44:50','2021-09-01 07:44:50','Seasonal development of the boll weevil and effects of different insecticide programs on insect populations and yield of cotton.','1982-09-01','The development period of Amorphoidea lata Motschulsky was studied.  The total development period in the laboratory ranged from 9 to 20 days with a mean of 14.62 days while adult emergence in field cages ranged from 16 to 19 days with a mean of  17.19 days. The development of boll weevil population on successive cotton crops was greatly influenced by the growing season. Higher rates of population increase were observed on crops planted in September, October and November than on those crops planted earlier. The highest rate of population increase was observed in October planting. The weevil population increased geometrically until maximum density was attained but as the season progressed and the number of available flowers became limited, the population progressively declined. The excessive wetness of the soil during the rainy season and high soil temperature during summer greatly influenced the population regulation of the weevils. Sidedressing carbofuran granules two weeks after plant emergence contributed greatly to increased bollworm infestation and significant yield reduction and monetary losses.  Carbofuran increased the vegetative growth of cotton plants, which made them more attractive for moth oviposition. Weekly foliar application of carbaryl and monocrotophos increased cotton yield significantly. Delaying the first application of foliar sprays until 45 days after plating did not significantly reduce yield than with those treated as early as 30 days after planting. The result showed the bright prospects of establishing optimum treatment levels against the insect pests of cotton.

It also showed the impact of the program on the tillage, sharing arrangement and farming participation of landowners. Compensation payments on transferred lands by the Land Bank was also discussed. The study used secondary data gathered from the Department of Agrarian Reform, the Agrarian Reform Institute, and the Land Bank of  the  Philippines. The data were categorized as to the sizes of landholdings in hectares: <1-7, 7-24, 24-50, 50-100 and above 100 ha. The land reform program seemed not to affect the livelihood of landowners.  Landowners whose lands were transferred to tenants had more assets than those not affected by Operation Land Transfer (OLT) program. The bulk of their income came from businesses and from landholdings not suited to rice and corn. Landlords who stopped cultivating their lands did so because of old age and poor health and not because of the land reform program. PD 27 affected  the sharing arrangement of landlords.  Tenants of landholdings subjected to OLT automatically became amortizing-owners. Tenancy arrangement on lands not included under OLT operations followed the leasehold system. Farming participation of landlords lessened after the implementation of PD 27 maybe because the government tried to act as the new landowner providing credit, technical assistance, marketing outlets, etc. As of December 1975, the Land Bank had purchased a total area of 14,000 ha owned by 657 landowners. Most of the lands transferred to tenants were holdings of nonresident landlords.  The average amount paid per landlord was P343,071 or P6,557/ha. The compensation payments were 81% in bonds, 10% in cash, 7% encumbrance and 2% of the amount was given as land rentals by the tenants. The impact of land reform on income and investment of ex-landowners could be observed better by studying the end use of the cash and bonds paid to them.

Primary data were collected from 75 individual respondents and 15 key informants in four rainfed barangays. Results showed that informal credit was the prevailing credit system in the rainfed areas. The borrowers were engaged in five forms of practices of informal credit, namely, balikan, bubulawan, palista, pipisaran and porsiyentuwan. Although there were several possible sources of informal credit, the bulk of the borrowers procured their loans mostly from comprador, sari-sari store owners and fellow farmers. On the other hand, formal borrowers had six sources of credit, namely, the Rural Bank of Legaspi, Samahang Nayon Credit Cooperative, Daraga Southern Development Cooperative , Inc., the Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation, Land Bank of the Philippines and United Coconut Planters Bank. The borrowers had to pass through a number of procedures or processes like filling up of application forms, provision of collateral and guarantor among others to avail of formal loans. These procedures/processes were not observed in informal credit system.

The study aimed to evaluate the process of implementation, project effects and impacts, and to assess the program as an approach to forest resource management based on (1) partnership between the government implementors and the participants; (2) attainment of the environmental objective and (3) attainment of the socioeconomic objectives. Results showed that the process of implementing ISFP in terms of land tenure, agroforestry and community organizing activities produced site-specific accomplishments ranging from satisfactory to unfavorable. ISFP was still inadequate in providing land-tenure security for agroforestry and tree planting. Moreover, community-organizing efforts were inadequate in some study sites. Factors considered were biophysical constraints, land tenure and economic considerations, sociocultural and political factors, administrative inadequacy, lack of technical capacity of the implementors, poor motivation and inconsistent funding. Environmental objective in terms of tree cover, soil restoration and forest protection were attained in grassland areas where climatic and biophysical conditions favored farming and where outside demands for forest products were lacking. These failed in areas where forested lots/farms were awarded, where participants have titled lands, where biophysical conditions constrained farming, and where forest protection drive was unsustainable. Social effects on population structure, community, values and traditions showed differential outcomes. Socioeconomic condition did not improve because the livelihood and income of the participants were still unpredictable and seasonal. Increase in total income was not enough to counter inflation rates; thus, participants were engaged in off-farm activities mostly depending on forest resources. ISFP forged the partnership between the government and the participants in the protection, conservation and development of the forest resources. However, ISFP still needed strengthening by considering the biophysical characteristics of the area to be managed, the socioeconomic conditions of the participants, and the institutional framework and support by the government. On the whole, the accomplishments of ISFP remained modest but the lessons learned could contribute to the development of more appropriate concepts in managing the forest resources.',NULL,NULL,'Reyes, Leopoldo F.','GOATS, REPRODUCTION, ADAPTABILITY, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, PHILIPPINES, Zoology',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2773,'2021-09-01 07:44:51','2021-09-01 07:44:51','Production standards for carabao skidding in fuelwood plantations.','1978-09-01','Production standards for four skidding cycle elements were developed using stepwise multiple regression technique.

Data were collected and sampled purposively from four corn-producing provinces in the Philippines. Theoretical explanations were based from the efficiency principles of economics, i.e., the first-best and second-best principles. The existence of different sharing arrangements across provinces and within a given location was attributed to the variations in land quality of the place, rural wages, cost contribution, tasks performed by the contracting parties, cropping intensity and the changes brought about by the Land Reform Program in the rice and corn areas of the country. Cost contributions of the contracting parties among all the factors identified significantly affected output sharing. The effects of land quality and wages on output sharing offset each other resulting in landowners\' shares which were nearly the same in all the provinces despite disparities in land quality and labor quantity in these provinces. Hence, the 33-67 was the most common. There was no significant difference in the resource utilization (land, labor, capital) between the owner-operated and the share-tenanted corn farms. However, higher output elasticities of these resources were observed in the share-tenanted farms. Changes in output shares where consistent with the predictions of the competitive theory of contracts. The effect of the Land Reform Program on the changes in output sharing was secondary.

Schofield) and mungbean (Phaseolus aureus). They were planted following rice harvest to simulate lowland rained paddy conditions in Cagayan Province in March 1981. All species were established using three methods, namely, Drilling/Planting in furrows (DRF), Broadcasting (BRD) and Dibbling (DIB) in between rice stubbles. Data were analyzed following the Split Plot Design. Only paragrass and three legumes -- mungbean, stylo and kadios -- were suitably adapted under the rainfed lowland condition in the experimental area. Paragrass produced the highest yield of 7.30 t/ha dry matter (DM) from three cuttings. Yield did not differ significantly among the two methods of establishment for grasses, but the three methods used for legumes were significantly different (P 0.05). Among the legumes, mungo gave the highest DM yield of 4.49 t/ha when drilled in furrows (DRF). Dry matter yield from kadios was highest when seeds were dibbled in between rice stubbles (1.65 t/ha). For stylo, the highest DM yield was obtained from direct BRD into the uncultivated paddy (0.47 t/ha). In the feeding trial (Phase II) to determine feeding value of the grown fodder for growing goats, 30 goats of approximately three months old with an average weight of 11 kg were assigned following a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) to three rations. These were A - stargrass pasture (grazing) + ipil-ipil soilage; B - paragrass + mungo hay; C - paragrass + mungo hay + 20% concentrate. Grazing goats (Treatment A) had a significantly higher (P  0.05) DM intake than those in semiconfinement (602.2 vs 454.8 and 451.9 g/day in Treatments B and C, respectively).

Benth to a grassland ecosystem were  conducted. Three experiments -- a box experiment, a leaching experiment, and a field experiment were setup. The box experiment studied the growth and development of six tree species in the presence or in the absence of cogon. The leaching experiment investigated the production of compounds by cogon which might be harmful to the growth of plants. The field experiment determined the adaptive capacity of the six species to grassland conditions. Performance of seedlings in all experiments was evaluated by growth in height, diameter, dry matter production and survival. Parameters such as microbial populations, soil and air temperature, light intensity, pH and tissue analysis were also determined. In the box experiment, plants established in pots without cogon exhibited a significant increase in height growth, diameter growth and dry matter production. On the other hand, plants established in pots with cogon showed a significant decrease in height growth, diameter growth and dry matter production. In the presence of cogon, however, ipil-ipil, agoho and Benguet pine showed significantly better growth than river red gum, binayoyo and alibangbang. In the leaching experiment, agoho seedlings exhibited the fastest height growth. River red gum appeared sensitive to the presence of leachate obtained from cogon. In addition, the presence of phenolic compounds in leachates coming from pots with cogon was detected. Amino acids and coumarins were not detected. In the field experiment, growth in height and diameter was not significantly different, however, significant differences in survival among the six species were evident. The highest survival rate was obtained by ipil-ipil, followed by agoho, river red gum and Benguet pine. Binayoyo and alibangbang seedlings gave the lowest survival. In the box experiment, populations of bacteria and fungi were higher at the end of the experiment than at the start of the experiment in the presence of cogon. Populations of actinomycetes decreased. In the absence of cogon populations of bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi increased. In general, there were more populations of microorganisms in boxes with cogon than in boxes without cogon. The concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and calcium generally were higher in the initial stage than in the terminal period. The concentration of magnesium in tissues of ipil-ipil, river red gum, Benguet pine, binayoyo and alibangbang increased. This increased concentration of magnesium agreed well with the results obtained in the box experiment. Concentration of nitrogen in ipil-ipil seedlings showed a slight increase. The concentration of phosphorus in the tissues of river red gum and Benguet pine increased slightly. In the box experiment, soil temperature was highest at 1:30 p.m. Soil temperature in boxes without cogon was much higher than in boxes with cogon. Air temperature was higher at 12 noon than at 6 a.m., 5 p.m. or 12 midnight both in the field and in the roof experiments. Light intensity was higher at 1:30 p.m. than at 8:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. on the roof top experiment. The initial soil pH in the box experiment was 6.0. However, the final soil pH decreased to about 5.4 in the presence of cogon and to 5.5 in the absence of cogon.

The organism gave a higher MCA:PA ratio compared with the standard organisms Rhizomucor pussillus and R. miehei. Optimization of the process conditions for milk clotting enzyme (MCE) production was done by submerged culture in shake flask and stirred tank fermenter. The optimum conditions for the production were substrate concentration of 4% wheat bran, an initial pH of 5.0, an inoculum size of 8 x 10 7 spores/100 ml substrate, incubation temperature of 30?C, and fermentation time of four days. Scale up production of the MCE in stirred tank fermenter, which was optimum at aeration rate of 0.4 vvm and agitation rate of 250 rpm, resulted in shorter fermentation time (three days). The downstream process included separation of mycelial growth in refrigerated centifugal separator. Then the broth was passed through a filter press and in an ultrafilter consisted of four columns of hollow fiber membrane to concentrate the sample. The enzyme was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation (30-90%) and a series of gel filtration using Sepharose CL 6B, which recovered 37% of the total activity. Molecular weight determination by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) showed that the enzyme was composed of two oligomeric  proteins.

The cooperative or group lending scheme implemented by the Land Bank of the Philippines and the Development Bank of the Philippines was the dominant financing scheme in the area. Through this lending scheme, the organized cotton farmers\' groups were able to avail of credit funds used to implement their own relending schemes. Another financing scheme was in the individual farmer lending of the rural banks. Furthermore, a number of farmers also engaged in self-financing. The marketing contract, as one requirement of lending banks, entered into by farmers with CFCs/CFAs (Cotton Farmers\' Associations) or traders and CFCs/CFAs with traders linked the credit market with the seed cotton market. The main reason for the link was to ensure good production results and good loan repayment. The computed lending cost of participating banks ranged from 21% to 94% with an average of about 40%. The lending cost was relatively lower than other credit programs for small farmers implemented by the government. The lending cost of the farmers\' groups engaged in relending schemes was higher than those of the banks with an average of 129.37%. High rate of loan default was the major cause for this condition. The borrowing cost of farmers by the different financing schemes differed statistically. On the average, farmer-borrowers incurred a P706.11 in availing loans from different lending institutions. This borrowing cost include P478.19 nominal interest and P227.92 transaction cost. Among the different components of transaction cost, farmers spent more for other loan charges collected by the lenders. The farmers favorably responded to credit schemes employed in seedcotton production, particularly the one channeled through the CFCs/CFAs. This was evidenced by the majority of the farmers adopting the scheme. The production performance as measured by the income generated from cotton growing did not vary significantly among farmers financed by the different financing schemes. On the average, the farmers obtained a seed cotton yield and net farm income of 799 kg/ha or 738 kg/farm and P4,157.17/ha or P3,839.82/farm, respectively.',NULL,NULL,'Torreno, Herminigildo S.','NICOTIANA TABACUM, ENTOMOLOGY, HETEROPTERA',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2018-06-28-04_ab_55274.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(2781,'2021-09-01 07:44:51','2021-09-01 07:44:51','Root acid phosphatase activity and phosphorus response of mungbean genotypes (Vigna radiata L.) in Luisiana clay.','1981-09-01','Root acid phosphatase had been associated with the plant\'s ability to grow in low phosphorus (P) supply. Hence, the study was conducted to explore the possibility of using the enzyme\'s activity as index for selecting mungbean genotypes with high tolerance to low available P condition. Three experiments (two greenhouse and one field) were conducted to evaluate the relationship between root acid phosphatase activity (APA), and P uptake, dry matter and grain yield of six selected mungbean genotypes. Root APA varied significantly among genotypes in hydroponic culture and in the pot experiment using Luisiana clay loam soil. Likewise, root APA differed significantly among P treatments. Significantly, different phosphorus uptake was also noted among genotypes in hydroponics pot and field experiments. The observed variations were attributed to differences in P absorbing ability among genotypes and to the difference in the nature and  concentration of P supply in the growth medium. Root APA appeared to have a role in increasing the supply of available phosphorus in the medium. The ability of the mungbean plant to utilize P from phytic acid was observed,  suggesting that organic P compounds in the soil were potential sources of P under limited mineral P supply. P uptake and dry matter yield were negatively related to root APA (r = -0.98 r = -0.95), which suggested that genotypes with low root APA had the ability to absorb more P and utilize it more efficiently than other genotypes with higher root APA. Dry matter and grain yield were positively related to P uptake (r = 0.95; r = 0.98) indicating that genotypes that could absorb more P in the soil with limited available P supply were more likely to produce higher grain yield than those with low P uptake.

The parameters studied were pH, initial inoculum level, and agitation and aeration rate. Growth in commercial yeast extract and brown sugar plus mineral salts medium (YEBS mineral salts medium) was comparable with yeast extract or Baker\'s yeast extract with mannitol plus mineral salts medium (YEM or BYEM mineral salts medium). Based on cost, YEBS mineral salts medium was cheaper than YEM or BYEM mineral salts medium. The unadjusted pH (pH 7.0) of YEBS mineral salts medium and the use of 1.0% initial inoculum level were optimum for the production of the three strains. The best combination of agitation and aeration rates for growing the Brahyrhizobium strains were 100 rpm and 0.50 vvm for strain USDA 110, 100 rpm and 1.0 vvm for strain M6, and 100 rpm and 0.25 vvm for strain 3G4b20. A chemostat was used to mass produce the three Brahyrhizobium strains. Although cell concentration decreased with dilution rate, the greater flow rate increased total cell production. Survival of the three Brahyrhizobium strains cultivated in yeast extract with brown sugar plus mineral salts medium was comparable to yeast extract with mannitol plus mineral salts medium. The results confirmed that mannitol in YEM mineral salts medium for production of Brahyrhizobium strains could be replaced with brown sugar resulting in a 77% reduction in the cost of production.

Specific leaf weight was not affected by increasing application of KCl. The application of 150 kg K2O/ha as KCl produced tobacco leaves with leaf-burn of 5.1 seconds, which was significantly lower than the control (20-30-0) with 6.4 seconds. Burning rate and leaf-burn were highest with zero K2O  application of KCl. Means of seven primings showed that leaves of the 150 kg K2O/ha treatment had a moisture adsorption of 20%, which was significantly higher than 18.15% for 30 kg K2O/ha treatment. Hygroscopicity contributed a negative effect on leaf-burn especially at the lug leaves. Specific leaf weight and leaf-burn increased from lug to tip leaves while hygroscopicity decreased. Potassium showed no influence on leaf-burn and burning rate. Chlorine at first priming and nicotine (TA) at first and third primings increased with KCl application. Chlorine showed an indirect relation to leaf-burn but directly related to hygroscopicity. Phosphorus counterbalanced the detrimental effect of Cl on leaf-burn at the lug (0.17% P, 3.6% Cl) and cutter (0.22% P, 1.8% Cl) leaves. However, both were positively correlated at the tip leaves (0.28%) P, 1.4% Cl). Calcium (2.1%) was detrimental on leaf-burn at the second priming and positively related to chlorine. Potassium and Cl content of flue-cured leaves decreased from lug to tip, Ca and Mg were highest at the lug leaves while P and TA increased from lug to tip leaves. Plants applied with KCl yielded the poorest mean leaf-burn at the lug leaves, 2.7 seconds, which was caused by high chlorine content. It was suggested not to harvest the lowest five to seven leaves because of high amount of Cl (4.1 to 3.1%) and Ca (3.5 to 2.1%) at the lug leaves, which caused highly hygroscopic (20.7%) flue-cured leaf and low leaf-burn (3.7 sec).

In artificial inoculations, all the banana isolates were virulent to commercial banana cv. Giant Cavendish (AAA), Lakatan (AAA) and Latundan (AAB), abaca cv. Tangongon and Heliconia latispatha Bentham; moderately virulent to virulent to white potato; weakly virulent to virulent to diploid banana cv. Butuhan (BB), eggplant, tomato, tobacco and castor bean; and avirulent to ginger, peanut, cowpea and pepper. The abaca isolates were avirulent to virulent to heliconia and the diploid banana; all isolates were weakly virulent to virulent to abaca but avirulent to ginger, peanut, cowpea, pepper and the three commercial banana cultivars ; all showed varying degrees of virulence to eggplant, tomato, castor bean, white potato and tobacco. In natural inoculations, all banana isolates were avirulent to Latundan, Butuhan, ginger, white potato, castor bean, peanut, eggplant, tobacco and pepper; some isolates were weakly to moderately virulent to Lakatan, abaca and tomato. All abaca isolates were avirulent to all these crops; some were weakly to moderately virulent to Lakatan, abaca and tomato. All abaca isolates were avirulent to all these crops; some were weakly to moderately virulent to castor bean, eggplant and tomato. The banana isolates infected healthy banana seedlings following inoculations by leaf pruning; the organism also invaded the fruit peduncle when the bract scars or cushions of the banana inflorescence were sprayed with the suspension. In heliconia plants, the organism moved from the inoculated flowers to the rhizome causing infection of the suckers. The abaca and banana isolates exhibited three morphotypes each on Kelman\'s medium; both did not cause hypersensitive reaction on tobacco. Colonies of banana isolates were also distinctly smaller than abaca isolates on PDPA. The banana isolates belonged to biovar 1 and produced slight tyrosinase activity while the abaca isolates belonged to biovars 2 and 3 and had both slight tyrosinase and very high tyrosinase-producing strains. Four distinct phase isolates from P. solanacearum infecting ginger and tomato failed to lyse both banana and abaca isolates. The abaca and banana isolates belonged to race 1 and race 2, respectively. The characteristics of banana isolates, tentatively designated as Phil. strain, were similar to the insect-transmitted strain A reported in Peru.

From the central office, key informants were from the information subsystems of the Ministry of Agriculture (MA) and the National Food and Agriculture Council (NFAC). In Region XI, 11 information personnel, 52 production technicians and 159 corn farmers served as respondents. Data were gathered through personal interviews, questionnaires, and existing documents/records pertinent to the study. The study showed that the information system of the MA was one of the most extensive information systems in the government. However, its communication support structure was lacking in integration as evidenced by the presence of various communication units/divisions within the system. This situation indicated the seemingly lack of unified leadership within the information subsystems of the Ministry. Although efforts were done to coordinate communication plans and activities, the weakness of the existing communication structure within MA inevitably resulted in the duplication and dissipation of communication resources and underutilization or overutilization of some resources. In general, information and extension personnel in Region XI were satisfied with their job. However, when specific aspects of satisfaction/dissatisfaction were analyzed, information personnel were dissatisfied with their salaries, staff development program, system of promotion and incentives, and communication support. Maisagana production technicians were dissatisfied with their salaries. Information and extension personnel derived their satisfaction from their interpersonal relationship with their coworkers.

Various factors affecting variable plant and insect interaction such as location and screening techniques caused these differences. Feeding and ovipositional antixenosis and antibiosis were operating as mechanisms of leafhopper resistance as indicated by low insect counts, longer duration of nymphal stage, higher insect mortality, shorter adult longevity and lower rate of population increase in resistant cultivars. In addition, nymphal emergence and rate of population increase were positively correlated to leafhopper counts while duration of nymphal period was negatively correlated to leafhopper counts in the feeding antixenosis test. The number of insects present in the cultivar therefore was a function of the combined effects of ovipositional and feeding antixenosis and the antibiotic affects influencing leafhopper population build up. Likewise, higher damage threshold level was observed in resistant cultivars than on UPL-C2 and DP 16. Highest damage threshold level was observed in A1a 894 (65) which was approximately 33 nymphs/plant at 75 days after plant emergence.

This was attributed to the increase incidence of stem and root rotting caused by Sclerotium rolfsii coupled with early and severe incidence of foliar diseases. Intensive cropping of soybean, peanut and mungbean on the same plot was allowable up to 3rd, 2nd and 1st consecutive planting without significant reduction in yield, respectively, while sorghum was allowable up to 4th cropping. Injurious consequences of intensive cropping could be partially alleviated by sequential cropping to a certain extent. Field and laboratory data suggested a positive relationship between sclerotial density of S. rolfsii and percent damped-off plants. Sclerotial density was high on plots planted continuously with soybean, mungbean and peanut while minimal density was recorded on plot continuously planted with sorghum. Aside from cropping pattern, sclerotial density was affected by rainfall, soil temperature and solar radiation. The effect of soil factors during intensive and sequential cropping could not be determined with greater confidence because of lack of significant changes in the soil factors and the critical level could not be established.

An artificial fertility gradient was created in an experimental field by incorporating graded doses of compost, N and P fertilizers in four strips formed in the area. A corn crop was grown to stabilize the fertility gradient. The cotton fertilizer calibration experiment consisting of 124 subplots was laid out in all the four strips following a special design. Seed cotton yield, fertilizer N and P applied and soil analysis for N and P in each plot before planting were fitted in a quadratic response function to formulate fertilizer adjustment equations.  Simple fertilizer trials in representative cotton production areas were conducted  for two cropping seasons following the fertilizer calibration experiment to validate the results of the calibration. The adjustment equation for fertilizer N derived from the quadratic response function calculated from the data of the field fertilizer calibration experiment was F=204.6 - 1.83 x ppm available nitrogen. For P, critical soil test values were determined instead of an adjustment equation because of the insignificant effect of fertilizer P on seedcotton yield. The critical values determined ranged from 3.5 to 6 ppm P for Bray P-2, 12.5 to 25 ppm P for Modified Olsen\'s, and 22 to 41 ppm P for Modified Truog. The revalidation trials pointed out that the fertilizer adjustment equation for N and the critical levels of P were useful in estimating N fertilizer requirements and in predicting possible presence of response to P fertilizers.

In the first experiment, growth hormones, namely, indole-butyric acid (IBA) and napthalene acetic acid (NAA) at various concentrations and a commercial hormone called Hormex, were used. Results showed that the seven treatments had no significant differences on their effect on rooting of almaciga cuttings. However, with their effect on survival, callus formation and shoot formation, treatment with a combination of 250 ppm IBA + 250 ppm NAA yielded the highest number of cuttings that survived and formed callus (24); followed by cuttings treated with 5000 ppm IBA (20); control (19); 1250 ppm IBA (10); 500 ppm NAA (5); 1250 ppm NAA (3) and Hormex (2). On shoot formation, treatment with 250 ppm IBA + 250 ppm NAA yielded the highest number of cuttings (15). Control ranked next (seven cuttings), then treatments with 500 and 1250 ppm NAA (six cuttings each), followed by 1250 ppm IBA (four cuttings), 500 ppm IBA (three cuttings) and the least was Hormex (two cuttings). Based on the results, a combination of IBA and NAA at 250 ppm level of concentration could be a better treatment to enhance root formation as evidenced by the formation of callus at the base of the cuttings. In the second experiment, two levels of the rooting hormones, 250 and 500 ppm IBA and NAA, were used as treatments. Aside from rooting hormone, two other factors, misting and chamber, were used to determine their effects on the propagation of almaciga cuttings. Results showed that rooting hormone, chamber and misting significantly increased survival and callus formation of almaciga cuttings. Among the nine treatments -- Control (T1), 250 ppm NAA (T2),  500 ppm NAA (T3), 250 ppm IBA (T4), 250 ppm IBA + 250 ppm NAA (T5), 250 ppm IBA + 500 ppm NAA (T6), 500 ppm IBA (T7), 500 ppm  IBA + 250 ppm NAA (T8), and 500 ppm IBA + 500 ppm NAA  (T9) -- T1 yielded the most number of cuttings that survived after four months (18 or 24%), followed by T3 (7 or 9%), T2 (6 or 8 %) and T4, T5 and T6 (1 or 1 %).

Statistical attributes of 23 anthropometric parameters were derived from 204 randomly selected male forestry workers representing 30% of the worker population in the area. The anthropometry of forestry workers with ages varying from 20 years old to 60 years old and an average weight of 59 kg showed that the average standing height was 161.3 cm while the average height in sitting position (upper body length) was 84.0 cm. The forward reach and underarm length measured to an average of 73.4 cm and 46.9 cm, respectively. Regarding detailed hand measurements, the average hand breadth was 10.8 cm and the average maximum grasp was 13.1 cm. On the broadness of the workers\' body, the average shoulder breadth was 43.0 cm and the breadth of the hips was 32.7 cm. The measurements of the body\'s lower limbs showed an average of 51.6 cm for knee height and 54.1 cm for average length from the back to the hollow of the knee. The working capacity of seven groups of workers performing different types of activity was determined through energy balance approach. For all seven groups, the average daily energy intake was about 3,439 kcal/day. The computed average daily energy requirement for each group of workers were 4,550 kcal/day for chainsaw operators, 4,012 kcal/day for high climbers, 3,375 kcal/day for chokermen, riggers and helpers in felling, yarding, skidding and loading operations. The average daily energy requirement was 3,594 kcal/day for plantation workers, 3,263 kcal/day for nurserymen, 3,127 kcal /day for foremen and mechanics and 2,600 kcal/day for machine operators. The results indicated a significant deficit in the energy balance of some of the workers assigned to specific forestry activity except for the machine operators, foremen and mechanics who had adequate energy to perform the required tasks. Energy deficit was mainly attributed to relatively high occupational energy requirements of some forestry tasks. There were seven types of tools, three types/models of equipment (Chainsaws) and five types of machines evaluated. The five types of machines evaluated were composed of three models of yarders, three models of skidders and three, two and one models/types of log loaders, haulers and crew buses, respectively.

It 1) determined the appropriate technologies on method of establishment, nitrogen (N) and weed management of newly released, drought-tolerant rice cultivars PSB RC 12 and PSB RC 14 and 2) compared these technologies with selected farmers\' technologies in Bacnotan, La Union under drought-prone lowland field conditions. The performance of PSB RC 12 and RC 14 as affected by method of crop establishment and organic and inorganic N fertilization showed that transplanted and broadcast-seeded, wetland rice gave comparable grain yields. This may be caused by broadcast-seeded wetland rice having more productive tillers and higher fresh straw than transplanted rice, although transplanted rice was taller and had higher number of filled grains per panicle. Grain yield were comparable between those plants fertilized with ammonium sulfate alone and ammonium sulfate plus ipil-ipil leaves fertilizer combinations. PSB RC 14, under broadcast-seeded, wetland condition, gave significantly higher grain yield than PSB RC 12 because of greater number of filled grains per panicle. However, PSB RC 12 had heavier seed weight. There were no significant differences in grain yield in plots treated with the different herbicides because of low weed pressure. In transplanted rice subjected to different weed management systems, PSB RC 14 gave grain yield significantly higher than PSB RC 12 because of more tillers. PSB RC 12 was taller than PSB RC 14 at 20 and 40 days after transplanting (DAT) but was shorter than the same at maturity. However, PSB RC 12 had longer panicle and heavier seed weight than PSB RC 14. Application of butachlor or thiobencarb at 1.0 hg/ha four DAT gave grain yields comparable with hand weeding 2x (20 and 30 DAT) and significantly higher than the unweeded. Rice grain fields from the technologies developed from earlier experiments were comparable with those of selected farmers\' technology at Bacnotan, La Union. However, net income analysis showed that for broadcast-seeded rice, PSB RC 14 fertilized with 40 kg N/ha using ammonium sulfate plus 20 kg N/ha using ipil-ipil leaves and sprayed with butachlor at 0.75 kg/ha four days after seeding (DAS) (Technology 1), PSB RC 14 fertilized with 40 kg/ha using ammonium sulfate and sprayed with butachlor at 0.75 kg/ha four DAS (Technology 2), and BPI Ri 10 fertilized with 40 kg N/ha using ammonium sulfate plus 20 kg N/ha using ipil-ipil leaves and sprayed with butachlor at 0.75 kg/ha four DAS (Technology 5) gave higher net income ranging from 87 to 111.90% higher than the farmers\' technology.

Return on investments of the developed technology for broadcast-seeded rice ranged from 59 to 64% compared to 29% of the farmers\' technology.

Statistical analysis revealed that paddy variety and type of mill had significant effects on grain breakage. Laboratory mill produced the least grain breakage followed by the modern mill, conventional mill, IVRM and kiskisan mill. Likewise shorter grains resisted grain breakage more than longer grains. Hulling and whitening operations accounted for the highest incidence of grain breakage. The conventional milling system and the kiskisan milling system produced the greatest grain breakage during hulling and whitening operations, respectively. Linear regression equation and correlation coefficient between grain breakage and temperature obtained were as follows: Br1 = -.1132 + 1.0051 (Temp), r1 = .927 for Dinitan; Br2 = -.112 + 1.31 (Temp.), r2 = .958 for IR-70; and BR3 = .1148 + 2.4281 (Temp.), r3 = .973 for IR-66 variety.

A steady and/or declining rate of growth was observed between the sixth and seventh week from removal of male inflorescence. Respiration rate was high at the early stage of fruit development then decreased as the fruit matured. Ethylene gas production remained undetected during fruit development. The amount of ethylene evolved was detected as the fruit began to ripen. Internal CO2 concentration was high at the time of male inflorescence removal and continued to decrease until the fourth week of development followed by a sharp rise on the fifth week then remained steady up to the sixth week.

Samples of buttons, both intact and abscised, were taken every week from stigmatic receptivity to the tenth week after receptivity to determine the site and pattern of abscission and relate the histological development to abscission. The materials were prepared as blocks, killed and fixed in CRAF III, embedded in paraffin, sectioned and stained following the standard procedures. Button shedding was greater in \'Coconi?o\' than in \'Laguna\' and their hybrid. The peak of button shedding in \'Coconi?o\' was on the first week, which was attributed mostly to nonfertilization. The peak in \'Laguna\' and the hybrid was observed on the fourth and fifth week after receptivity, respectively. The peak of abscission almost coincided with the initial zygotic  division. GA and CK application improved the fruit setting of the two cultivars and their hybrid. Only one abscission zone where separation took place was detected. It was a distinct region composed of 3-12 tiers of densely protoplasmic, thin-walled, longer than wide angular parenchyma cells, which were comparatively smaller than the cells of the adjoining tissues. Heavy shedders and light shedders were distinguished by the nature of their abscission zone. No cell division was observed prior to separation.  Separation started in several places in the abscission zone by dissolution of cells forming an extensive cavity across the abscission zone. The separation layer did not extend across the vascular tissues. Separation in the vascular tissues was effected by mechanical force. Several causes of abscission were detected. Foremost among them was mechanical injury caused by insect and fungus, followed by double cavity/embryo development and lysigenous integumentary tissues. About ten percent of the abscised buttons were attributed to unknown cause but interpreted as caused by hormonal deficiency.  Nonfertilization of the egg was also considered. Histological development particularly the vascular tissues and fibers appeared associated with abscission.

Further efforts to purify isolate A by thin layer chromatography failed to separate the components.

HD-595 and C-27 were the most toxic with LC50 of 62.52 and 79.41 mg/Li, respectively. The pathogenicity of the three commercial products to Setora sp. A and Darna sp.

The various strata included parang or mix grassland and second growth forest (200-250 m elevation), dipterocarp forest (550-600 m), mid-mountain (85-900 m), mossy forest (950-1,300 m) and coniferous forest (2,000-2,158 m). A total of 179 specimen, involving 50 species and subspecies of birds, was collected in both mountains. From the species collected, 22 or 44% were found in Mt. Banahaw and 14 or 28% in San Cristobal. However, 14 or 28% of the collection were found in both areas. Mt. Banahaw avifauna was represented by six orders, 63.64% of which were perching or passerine species and the rest were composed of doves, sparrow-hawks, heron, woodpeckers and owls in that order of importance. Comparatively, 92.86% of San Cristobal\'s birds were passerine species. Majority of the bird families specific to San Cristobal were parang-type and partly ecotonal in distribution. Specimen from Mt. Banahaw had greater diversity in both genera and species compared to San Cristobal\'s poorer if not monotonous bird community. In both areas, birds having either restricted or wide-ranging movements were well represented. Numerical distribution of birds in Mt. Banahaw depicted a mid-mountain-dipterocarp-mossy-parang-conifer forest order of prominence. San Cristobal, which lacked a conifer forest zone, showed a mid-mountain-parang-dipterocarp-mossy forest prominence. Three orders of mammals, which included an insectivore, 3 genera and 5 species of rodents and 9 genera and 14 species of bats were well distributed in both mountains. Rat species associated to man were distinct where \'kaingin\' and fallowed land existed. Also, pteropid bats, which were largely fructivorous were most common in Mt. Banahaw, while those of the denuded and kaingined San Cristobal were largely insectivorous. Animal succession were profoundly exhibited in San Cristobal as an apparent product of vegetative change. A total of 45 species of birds belonging to 35 genera, 20 families and 9 orders was contributed by the study to the new list of Mt. Banahaw-San Cristobal National Park avifauna.

Samples were made separately of entire young plants, young leaves, old leaves, flowers, young pods and matured pods. The vegetative stage covered the longest period of the entire growth stage of the crop. It was during this stage that the three trophic levels of mites were most abundant. Population densities of the spider mites, Schizotetranychus lechrius on Stylo was very low at an average of 0.0042 per leaf, a density hardly representing a pest situation on the crop. The major predator-prey pair consisted of the phytoseiid, Amblyseius longispinosus, and the spider mite, S. lechrius. Their distribution in space and time closely resembled each other. The predator was more or less uniformly distributed on the different types of plant parts and persisted during the entire growth period of the plant. During the flowering stage, A. longispinosus along with other phytoseiids attained its highest densities.

The three sweet potato varieties significantly differed in their primary and total vine lengths in response to increasing moisture tension. Kinarause Puti exhibited the highest primary and total vine length. BNAS 51 gave the largest leaf area and Kinarause Puti the smallest. Most of the leaf area reduction was noted from plants stressed at 75 days after planting and less reduction on plants stressed at 45 and 66 days after planting. Kinarause Puti produced the highest effective leaves per plant. Plants stressed at 60 days after planting had greater number of effective leaves, but it did not differ significantly with the other treatments. BNAS 51 obtained the highest root-shoot ratio.

The market structure of NAFILMA approached that of an oligopoly where the major determining factor was the limited number sellers (fish brokers) and concentration of market share in the hands of a few. For every tub of fish sold, the average marketing cost was estimated at P5.10 for the producer and P2.69 for the broker. The broker\'s gross marketing margin was P4.86 per tub, which gave him a profit (before income tax) of P2.17 per tub. Gross marketing margins were fixed percentages of the retail prices implying that as retail prices increased, marketing margins also increased. In terms of shares in the consumer\'s peso, the producers accounted for 57%  and the marketing group, 43%. Pricing analysis showed that, in general, estimates of the relationships of the price of fish by species with the quantity demanded by the price and the quantity of all other species were significant for the more predominant species. The direct and cross price flexibilities were less than one for practically all the species, implying that the percentage changes in prices were less than the corresponding percentage changes in quantities. It also implied that the demand for fish was elastic, which in turn implied that total revenue from each species might be expected to increase with a decrease in its price. However,  the price elasticity of demand for fish in the aggregate, i.e. for all species together, was much less than the individual elasticities of any of the species. The cross price flexibilities were mostly negative, implying substitutions among the different species. Both pricing and operational inefficiencies obtained in the market and identified as caused mainly by the oligopolistic structure of the market and the lack of knowledge about the market, which were caused by the poor and inadequate market facilities and the method of selling in secret auction or \"whisper bidding\". Policy implications dictated that any attempt to improve the efficiency of the market must be approached as a system and directed towards improving the conditions that would make possible such marketing practices.',NULL,NULL,'Saplaco, Melchora R.','FORESTRY, RESEARCH, HUMAN BEHAVIOR, SOCIAL VALUES, Social sciences',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2823,'2021-09-01 07:44:51','2021-09-01 07:44:51','The effect of various sources of phosphorus on milkfish (Chanos chanos Forskal) production on brackishwater ponds.','1982-09-01','This study was conducted from September 1981 to February 1982 using 18 earthen ponds of approximately 40 sq m at the Brackishwater Aquaculture Center (BAC) of the University of the Philippines in the Visayas (UPV), Iloilo City.  The effects of various sources of phosphorus fertilizer were evaluated on the physico-chemical and chemical properties of the pond water and soil, primary productivity and fish yield. The study included six treatments: 1 (control), 2 (urea only), 3 (urea + rock phosphate), 4 (urea + solophos), 5 (urea + rock phosphate + solophos phosphate/double P2O5  dosage) and 6 (monoammonium phosphate). The highest concentrations of available phosphorus in the soil were obtained in the double P2O5 dosage treatment. The available phosphorus was significantly correlated with soil pH and extractable iron. The average weekly concentrations of dissolved inorganic  phosphate in water were significantly higher in the solophs (0.55 ppm), double P2O5 dosage (0.45 ppm) and monoammonium phosphate (0.28 ppm) treatments than in the rock phosphate (0.18 ppm), urea (0.20 ppm) and control 0.17 ppm) treatments. A positive and significant relationship of dissolved inorganic phosphate was observed with water pH, water-soluble iron and total alkalinity. The average concentration of NH3 -N in water was significantly higher in the monoammonium phosphate treatment (0.29 ppm) than in others that also received the same amount of N from urea. The concentrations in other treatments were urea (0.13 ppm), solophos (0.11 ppm), rock phosphate (0.18), double P2O5 dosage (0.11) and control (0.10 ppm). The average weekly primary productivity measured by the three-point diel oxygen level was highest in the solophos treatment (16.72 ppm) and lowest in the double P2O5 dosage treatment (14.79 ppm). The highest net fish yields of 535.7 and 534.4 kg/ha were obtained in the control and urea treatments, respectively, but statistically they were not different from the yields obtained in other treatments. The average survival of the fish ranged from 83 to 100% where the control and double P2O5 dosage treatments had 100% survival rate.

The plants were fertilized with nitrate-nitrogen equivalent to 0, 30, 60 and 90 ppm added to modified Hoagland\'s solution. Drought was imposed by withholding water for ten days starting from 15 days after emergence. Nitrate reductase activity (NRA), relative water content (RWC), tissue nitrate, free proline, stomatal aperture, resistance and density were determined every other day and at 24 hours after rewatering. As leaf RWC progressively decreased, NRA also consistently decreased while leaf tissue nitrate and free proline contents increased. At the end of the stress period, NRA was as low as 35.92, 30.48, 28.48 and 28.04% of the control in UPCA Var I plants fertilized with 0, 30, 60 and 90 ppm N, respectively, and 30.78, 26.91, 25.08 and 23.83% of the control in Across 8075 with the same rate of fertilizer application, respectively.

The effects of plant density by varying plant distances within the row of 20, 25 and 30 cm spacings were likewise studied. The average seedling height at transplanting was significantly different among the four TPS entries. No significant differences were observed among the treatments on plant height at vegetative stage. The differences in number of surviving plants both after the establishment period and at harvesting were highly significant with 78-99 as the highest and D-12 the lowest. No significant differences were observed on the size of marketable tubers. High variabilities were observed, however, on tuber size, height and weight of tubers per plant. D-12 had the most uniform tubers while Marilyn had the highest variability.

The main objective was to make an assessment of the local people participation in the various stages of the management activities of the Bicol IAD projects from the point of view of the members of the management staff and the project beneficiaries themselves. Data were gathered through personal interviews with the farmer-beneficiaries using semistructured interview schedules and questionnaires for the members of the project management staff (PMS). Additional information were taken from available minutes of meetings, records of proceedings and project papers of the four IAD projects. Findings showed that the local people participation generally took varied forms depending on (a) the stage of the IAD project management process at which participation was elicited, (b) the mechanism used to elicit local people participation and (c) the nature of the IAD project activities where the rate of participation declined as the management activities progressed to the more technical stages. Selected socio-psychological and economic variables significantly affected the active participation of people in the management of the IAD projects. These were (a) tenure status, (b) attendance in training  activities, (c) membership in local-based organizations, (d) value orientation of the respondents, (e) leadership style of the PMS members and the barangay officials, (f) perceived benefits from the projects and (g) availability of government assistance and other supportive services at the field level.

Field experiments were conducted in Alimodian (pH 7.4) and Isarog (pH  5.6) paddy soils to determine the response of lowland rice (IR 42) to direct application of the Fe/Al phosphate rocks. The first set of laboratory experiments involved periodic measurement of water-soluble P with time in Luisiana and Isarog soils limed to pH 5.5 and 6.5 with five chemical amendments (CaCO3, CaSiO3, 4:1 CaCO3 - NaOH, 2:1 CaCo3 - NaOH, and 1:1 CaCO3 - NaOH) and treated with three phosphate materials (single superphosphate, calcined Fe/Al phosphate rock and uncalcined Fe/Al phosphate rock). The second set of laboratory experiments involved determination of the phosphate sorption isotherms of the same soils limed to pH 5.5 and 6.5 using the five chemical amendments. The increase in concentration of soluble P with time was generally higher in the soils limed with CaSiO3 at pH 5.5 than at pH 6.5. The relative increase in soluble P concentration at pH 5.5 followed the order: CaSiO3 > 2:1 CaCO3 - NaOH > CaCO3 & 4:1 CaCO3 - NaOH & 1:1 CaCO3 - NaOH. The phosphate sorption isotherms also showed higher soluble P concentrations at pH 5.5 with CaSiO3 and 2:1 CaCO3 - NaOH than at pH 6.5. The apparent increase in the availability of P from Fe/Al phosphate rocks caused by the application of the two liming materials at pH 5.5 was confirmed by the results of the greenhouse experiment with corn as a test crop. However, the calcined Fe/Al phosphate rock was more effective than the uncalcined phosphate rock. Evaluation of agronomic effectiveness of Fe/Al phosphate rocks directly applied to Alimodian and Isarog soils showed contrasting results. There was no significant response of lowland rice to either phosphate rock or single superphosphate application in Isarog soil where the zero-P treatment (80-0-60) produced as high as 8.69 t grain/ha.

Extractable boron was positively correlated with soil organic matter, pH and exchangeable calcium but negatively correlated with clay contents. Soils containing 0.02 to 0.09 ppm of extractable boron produced hollow stems, curled leaves and brownish curds. There were nine soil types that were deficient in boron. The boron-deficient soils were individually treated with one, two and three percent of decomposed chicken manure, CaCO3, Ca (NO)3 and HCl and incubated at 0, 22 and 30?C for one week. The extractable boron increased by 0.039, 0.075 and 0.033 ppm with addition of one, two and three percent chicken manure, respectively, while exchangeable calcium decreased at one and two percent but increased when CaCO3 and Ca (NO3)2 was applied, but it decreased using HCl. The hot-water extractable boron decreased at 0 and 30?C. The amount of boron and calcium absorbed by the cauliflower were proportional to its availabilities; however, when calcium was increased to 9.8 m.e./100 g soils using CaCO3, boron contents of tissue were reduced. Below this amount, an increase in boron absorption was followed by a corresponding increase in calcium contents. Ca(NO3)2 did not reduce boron contents even at 14.24 m.e. Maybe this was caused by nitrate ions. The rates and method of applying boron under field conditions showed that 5 ppm of boron solution using foliar spray was the best in preventing abnormalities of cauliflower but 1 ppm was enough when soil application would be used. Once the level of boron was increased to 10 ppm, it would become toxic when applied into the soil but not when dipping the seedlings in boron solution.

On the other hand, Experiment II, which consisted of capons subjected to three feeding schemes from 4 to 19 weeks, was conducted to determine the influence of dietary treatments on the performance of capons. Experiment I showed that caponization had a slight depressing effect on the growth of male broilers but statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in growth between the capons and cockerels at any age studied. Although no significant differences on feed consumption and feed conversion efficiency were observed, capons showed slightly better feed conversion efficiency than the intact cockerels. Dressing percentage and carcass scores were better for the capons than the intact cockerels at 12, 16 and 19 weeks of age. Organoleptic scores were consistently better for the capons than the cockerels although the difference were statistically insignificant. Experiment II showed no significant influence of any of the feeding schemes used on the growth, feed consumption and feed conversion efficiency of capons at 19 weeks. Mortality, dressing percentage and quality of carcass were also not significantly affected by the feeding schemes. Based on the results of these two experiments, capon raising was generally more favorable than the intact cockerels especially on the quality of the meat. Obviously, meat production from capons was much more expensive than raising ordinary broiler. Therefore, capons must be sold at a higher price than the prevailing price of broilers. Capon can be ready for market as early as 12 weeks of age but if larger capons are desired, they can be grown much longer.

From these results, it can be deduced that Mamalis could be propagated through shoot tip cuttings even without the application of growth hormones. However, the number of macroroots and root density was higher in the cuttings treated with 75 ppm NAA while root length was longest in the cuttings treated with 50 ppm NAA. The result of acclimatization of clones in the nursery for two months suggested that height of clones was significantly improved by growing them in pure garden soil instead of the mixture of soil and sand. However, there were no significant effects of fertilizer application as well as its interactions with potting media and hormone level on growth parameters such as root density, root length and leaf formation. Furthermore, to assess the feasibility of the technology, the clones must be subjected to longer periods of acclimitization to allow stabilization of inoculant and establish the effect of fertilizer on tissue synthesis. The study demonstrated the applicability of rooting of mamalis stem cuttings in the establishment of clonal orchards and Seed Production Areas (SPA).',NULL,NULL,'Solsoloy, Teodoro S.','GOSSYPIUM, INSECT CONTROL, BIOLOGICAL CONTROL, TRICHOGRAMMA AUSTRALICUM, HELICOVERPA ARMIGERA, Zoology',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2835,'2021-09-01 07:44:51','2021-09-01 07:44:51','A study of the trash fish caught by otter trawl in the Visayan Sea.','1991-09-01','A nine-month study on the distribution, abundance and ecology of trash fish in the Visayan Sea was presented.

Sweet potato grown on furrow gave the highest yields of storage roots and marketable storage roots, the most marketable storage roots per plant and the biggest marketable storage roots. The ratio of marketable storage roots to nonmarketable storage roots was significantly high in plants grown on either furrow or plot. The number of storage roots per plant decreased with increasing rates of N-K fertilizer. Unfertilized plants produced the most storage roots per plant. The application of either 50-50 or 150-150 kg N-K/ha increased the ratio of marketable storage roots to nonmarketable storage roots. BNAS 51 fertilized with 50-50 kg N-K/ha produced the most marketable storage roots per plant and the highest yields of storage roots and marketable storage roots.

Regrowth of Themeda grass after cutting depended more on cutting interval than on cutting height. Highest regrowth yield was obtained at a 90-day cutting interval with a dry matter production rate of 20.32 kg/ha per day. Yields for the 30- and 60-daycutting intervals were 18.35 and 17.79 kg/ha per day, respectively. Regrowth yield was associated with leaf area index (LAI) as data indicated the highest LAI for the 90-day cutting interval. The low regrowth yield at 30-day cutting interval was caused by shorter time available for vegetative growth of the grass. Cutting interval also influenced the crude protein (CP) content of the grass. The highest CP recorded was 10.65% with cutting interval of 30 days at a height of 21 cm while the lowest was 3.26% with the 90-day cutting interval. Root samples were taken and analyzed for nonstructural carbohydrate (cell content) and structural carbohydrate (hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin and silica) to assess the carbohydrate status of Themeda at different cutting management. Cell contents did not differ significantly among cutting height but difference occurrred between cutting interval. Themeda cut at 30-day interval at 21 cm height had the highest energy status.

Seeds were collected from each of five trees in 14 provenances distributed throughout its natural range in Luzon. The seeds were sown and grown separately by family and by provenance in Forestry Nursery in Baguio City. Data were taken from cone size, seed and seedling parameters. The results were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance for cone and seed parameters including hypocotyl length and a two-way analysis of variance for seedling parameters. In the analysis of seedling parameters, sources of variations were subdivided into random effects because of provenance, replication, interaction between provenance and replication, families within provenance and families within replication.  Correlation coefficient for measured traits was also computed. In all the parameters used in the analyses, there was a general indication of the genetic variability of the species. Most of the quantitative characters studied, such as cone length, cone diameter, seed weight, seed yield per cone, germination percent, hypocotyl length, seedling height, root collar diameter, root length and shoot-root length ratio, showed significant differences associated with provenance. Likewise, significant differences were noted on families within provenance. The resulting high variance component associated with families within provenance was considered a strong indication that appreciable genetic gain could be obtained by employing further individual tree selection within the best provenance. The analyses showed that great genetic variability existed not only between provenances but also between families or trees within each provenance. The statistical differences noted in each parameters were interpreted as an expression of genetic variability since environmental pressure or effect was maintained uniform throughout the study. In most of the parameters observed, provenances from the Central Cordillera, particularly those from Benguet and Kayapa, had clearly indicated their superiority over the other provenances based on quantitative analysis of the different morphological juvenile traits of Benguet pine seedlings.

The influence of such inputs on plant was directly or indirectly associated with the internal soil environment, external microclimate and type of management imposed.  Known responses of plant to imposed treatments were usually location or site specific because of the known variations of these variables in short distances and in time. Extrapolations of research results depended on whether or not the same conditions of the soil, climate and management could be properly identified. Morphological studies along with certain crucial physical and chemical properties provided the base to classify the soil used as a member of the subgroup vertic calciustoll, family of fine clayey, isohyperthermic, montmorillonitic. With such a name, the critical properties affecting plant growth were also generally identified. Aside from the most common properties associated with a calcareous material of montmorillonitic mineralogy, the soil possessed a conspicuous instability. This influenced soil water relations, which could allow the system to increase the retentive forces holding the water even if the soil continued to shrink upon drying. Soil water conditions were monitored regularly using resistance blocks calibrated in terms of moisture content and suctions. Increasing amounts and frequency of irrigation did not show appreciable differences in growth and yield components of the cotton plants. Regardless of the amount and frequency of water applied, soil moisture depletion appeared as a logarithmic function of time that could be characterized by a b-parameter (soil water reduction factor relating loss of the remaining water per unit of time). The b-parameter was a gross measure of hydraulic properties of the soil affecting drainage, evaporation and transpiration. Furthermore, soil moisture depletion patterns showed similarity among irrigation overall nitrogen treatments indicating that additional water compared to the least amount did not cause significant improvement in seedcotton yields. Cotton plants responded significantly to varying levels of nitrogen, which resulted to higher soil water reduction correspondingly as measured by the b-factor. The lowest b\'s were observed in plots where no nitrogen was added. Since increasing water addition did not show improvement in yields, it would be expected that the least amount of irrigation would lead to the highest water use efficiency. In the presence of a positive curvilinear response to nitrogen, an interaction effect between water use and nitrogen added followed showing the highest efficiency at the lowest water addition with nitrogen levels at about the maximum point of the yield response curve (100-12- kg N/ha). The study showed that continuous monitoring of soil water condition could be practically implemented to detect the course of water depletion and the existence of water stresses. It was also possible to determine not only the time but also the amount of water to be added to avoid the occurrence of water stresses and excess in irrigation whether or not the plants received dressings of fertilizers.',NULL,NULL,'Tejada, Gamaliel D.','DIFFUSION OF INFORMATION, RESEARCH, AGRICULTURE, RESEARCH NETWORKS, ILARRDEC, ILOCOS REGION',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2848,'2021-09-01 07:44:51','2021-09-01 07:44:51','Grain yield performance of grain sorghum as affected by tillage, mulching and herbicides.','1982-09-01','With sorghum (Cosor 3) as the test crop, the influence of tillage, mulching and herbicides on the grain yield, species and densities of weeds and weed yield were investigated.

Hierarchical cluster analysis (UPGMA) identified three zymotype patterns exhibited by the \'Carabao\' mango accessions and 19 zymotypes of the 107 accessions. PCA analysis showed the divergence of \'Makiling\' ,  \'Bauno\'  and \'Pali\' from the M. indica cultivars. Thus, isozymes can be used as genetic marker for mango and for breeding, particularly to identify the hybrids from the nucellar seedlings as early as the seedling stage when using \'Carabao\' mango as parent. It could also be used as an aid in establishing a more genetically homogenous population for commercial mango orchards and detect mislabelling. Heirarchical cluster analysis (UPGMA) performed on dissimilarity matrix based on the Euclidean Distance on 22 morphological characters revealed 8 clusters of the \'Carabao\' mango accessions and 11 clusters of the 107 accessions. Fruit, seed and peel weight were identified to best discriminate among clusters of the \'Carabao\' mango accessions. Variation in morphological characters was due to genotype-environment interaction. Leaf characters could help differentiate species of mango.',NULL,NULL,'Tolentino, Ceferino T.','SOIL CLASSIFICATION, COCOS NUCIFERA, PLANT SOIL RELATIONS, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2850,'2021-09-01 07:44:51','2021-09-01 07:44:51','Environmental impacts and some factors affecting firewood extraction: the case of Callao Caves National Park Upper Watershed Area, Penablanca, Cagayan.','1977-09-01','(no abstract)',NULL,NULL,'Tomaneng, Antonio A.','SOIL FERTILITY, LAND USE, PLANT PRODUCTION, PLANT SOIL RELATIONS, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2851,'2021-09-01 07:44:51','2021-09-01 07:44:51','Persistence of rhizobia in some Philippine soils.','1981-09-01','The behavior of rhizobia in soils under different conditions was studied using streptomycin resistant mutants.

All strains tested survived and infected the host plant in Luisiana clay (pH 4.5), Lipa clay loam (pH 4.7), Antipolo clay (pH 5.1), Lipa clay loam (pH 6.2), Taal sandy loam (pH 6.4) and Binangonan clay (pH 7.5). The proportion of nodules formed by the inoculum strains was influenced more by competition with the indigenous rhizobial population than by soil pH. Liming an acid soil to raise the pH from 5.1 to 6.5 and/or phosphorus application increased the proportion of nodules formed by the inoculum strains. Seed pelleting with a mixture of lime and superphosphate was beneficial only for strain M-5. In the absence of the host plant, the number of the introduced rhizobia decreased significantly in Lipa clay loam (pH 4.7) but not in Lipa clay loam (pH 6.2) and Binangonan clay (pH 7.5).

The results showed that for the three vessels, the number of viable bacteria in fish sauce followed similar trends of increase and decrease although the number per se was different. Changes in the number of viable bacteria in the fermenting fish sauce were correlated with changes in pH. For the three vessels, the estimated correlation coefficient between the two factors ranged form negligible to slight relations.

The effect of the  treatment on the resistance of white lauan to the attack of the fungi Fomes lividus (Kalchbr. Sacc.) and Lenzites striata Swartz ex Fries was determined using the soil-lock test. After the test, the materials were examined microscopically. A significant improvement in the decay resistance of white lauan was attained even at the lowest acetylation level. Increasing the degree of acetylation resulted in additional protection such that the attacks of L. striata and F. lividus were prevented at 12 and 14% weight gain, respectively. The mechanism  of the effectiveness of acetylation against decay fungi was related to the blockage of fungal enzymes although exclusion of cell wall water might have also contributed to the decay resistance of acetylated white lauan. The resistance of acetylated white lauan to the attack of the subterranean termite Microcerotermes losbanosensis Oshima was determined using a laboratory evaluation test. The effect of acetylation was apparent only when the weight gain was about ten percent. However, the level of acetylation, which could provide sufficient protection from the attack of the termite, remained to be determined. The dimensional stability, density and specific gravity of white lauan was increased upon acetylation. The bulking effect of the treatment and the reduction in hygroscopicity of the acetylated material were responsible for the increase in dimensional stability while the added weight of the chemicals was responsible for the increase in density and specific gravity of treated wood. The mechanical properties of acetylated wood were, in general, higher than those of the untreated materials. The fiber stress at proportional limit in static bending, stress at proportional limit in compression perpendicular to the grain, and toughness of white lauan increased upon treatment; the modulus of elasticity in static bending showed an erratic response to acetylation, while the shear strength parallel to the grain decreased upon acetylation.

Diseased leaves with young lesions were selected, and sections were cut from the advancing lesions and placed in between potato slices. Eliminating the use of sodium hypochlorite, the technique relied entirely on skill and speed of transfer. After five days, profuse growth of the fungus appeared on the surface of tuber slices incubated in petri plates. Growth was transferred by touching agar blocks onto the fungal growth and/or cutting diseased sections of the tuber. They were transferred to either V8 juice agar, potato dextrose agar, or carrot agar. All of which were mixed with antibiotics piramicin, ampicillin, polymyxin B sulfate, streptomycin sulfate and fungicides benomyl and tetrachlor.  Growth was observed after two weeks, although it took one month to fill a plate. Microscopic examination revealed that sporangia were hyaline and lemon shaped and had a distinct papilla at the tip. The sporangiophores were hyaline and had no septations. Sporangia obtained from leaves and tubers were longer and wider than those from artificial media. In the pathogenicity test, inoculum from Natubleng, Buguais was the most virulent. Red Pontiac variety sprayed with the inoculum  developed late blight lesions much earlier and produced bigger and more lesions. The local varieties, Granola, Cosima and Conchita, had significantly higher blight infection, bigger and more lesions compared to CIP cultivars 720088 and 573272, which showed no infection at all. The other CIP cultivars, 573079, 720044 and 573255, also showed good resistance to late blight. Among the local varieties, Granola produced the biggest lesions confirming reports that this variety is moderately susceptible to late blight. In addition, more lesions developed in Greta, Conchita and cultivar Cruza varieties reported to have resistance to late blight. The occurrence of a high number of lesions was attributed to the high average number of leaves per plant exhibited by these varieties.

Imported fish meals from Chile, Thailand and the U.S. were found to be adulterated in varying proportions of about 3.3% blood meal, 4.5% dried poultry manure and 2.9% feather meal, respectively. The Peruvian fish meal, noncommercial dilis, tuna and tulingan were of pure composition. The highest bone and scale content was obtained from Thailand fish meal with 23.65% while the lowest was recorded in dilis fish meal with 9.04%. Dilis fish meal gave the highest crude protein content with 67.76% while Thailand fish meal gave the lowest with 44.92%. In terms of protein quality, Thailand fish meal had the poorest as shown by its low total amino acid value (as percent of feed). U.S. fish meal gave the highest value, closely followed by dilis fish meal. The essential amino acid content of different fish meals when incorporated at 10% in the diet was found inadequate to meet the dietary requirements of broilers. Body weights seemed to be directly related to feed consumption. The diet with Peruvian fish meal recorded the highest weight gain in broiler with 1,836 g at eight weeks but was not significantly different from those of diets containing tulingan, Chilean, dilis and tuna fish meals. Feed consumption of broilers was highest in the diet containing Peruvian fish meal at 4,311 g/broiler and was lowest in the diet with U.S. fish meal at 2,464 g.

Calves were randomly allocated into four treatments: I - Control, whole milk; II - Frozen colostrum; III - 0.05% Formaldehyde-treated colostrum; and IV - 0.7% Acetic acid-treated colostrum. All animals were given similar feeding and management routines. Bovine colostrum was higher in total solids, protein, lactose and total ash than in normal milk. This highly nutritious colostrum was generally produced in large amounts and was usually in excess of a calf\'s requirement. Excess colostrum properly stored by freezing and by the addition of chemical preservatives was an economical substitute for milk and milk replacer. Among the three different methods of preservation, freezing could significantly prevent rapid nutrient degradation particularly of protein and milk fat. Colostrum with 0.7% acetic acid had the lowest protein and milk fat contents and the highest lactose value at day 14. The addition of chemical preservatives to colostrum initially and rapidly reduced pH. Frozen colostrum showed a slow pH decline. Nevertheless, fermentation probably took place during storage as titratable acidity increased at days 7 and 14. T2, T3 and T4 had low pH at day 14, with an average of 4.45, 3.60 and 3.35, respectively. Acidity was not correlated with coliform and total plate counts but was positively correlated with yeast and mold growth. Freezing enhanced the growth of microorganisms.  Chemical additives significantly lowered coliform counts but favored bacterial growth and yeast and mold proliferation. Coliform and total plate counts were negatively correlated with total protein, but yeast and mold showed otherwise. On odor, color and consistency, freezing seemed effective in maintaining the fresh qualities of colostrum . The addition of 0.05% formaldehyde and 0.7% acetic acid to colostrum was ineffective in maintaining such qualities. Frozen and formaldehye-treated colostrum were readily acceptable to calves. Colostrum with acetic acid had a significantly lower acceptance with an average of 30% from open pails, 10% from nipple feeding and 60% on forced feeding. A very high acceptance for whole milk, after shifting calves immediately from colostral feeding, was noted. At 35 days, average body weights, daily gain, feed consumption and feed conversion efficiency did not vary significantly among treatments. Calves receiving colostrum with formaldehyde suffered diarrhea at an increasingly significant rate followed by calves fed with acetic acid-treated colostrum. Calves fed with frozen colostrum were comparable to the control on low scouring profile. Considering that excess colostrum had no market value, the price and availability of chemical additive, ease in handling and storage, acceptability of preserved colostrum and the calf performance, utilization of formaldehyde preserved colostrum was an economical substitute for milk and milk replacer and was indeed recommendable in dairying.',NULL,NULL,'Turnos, Nicolas A.','EGG PLANT, MATURITY, STORAGE, FROST DAMAGE',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2859,'2021-09-01 07:44:52','2021-09-01 07:44:52','Equity and employment effects of technological change in corn in the Philippines.','1981-09-01','The study analyzed the effect of technological change in corn on income distribution among and between producers and consumers and traced its impact on employment and the process of research prioritization in the country with special emphasis on corn. Both time series and cross-section data were used in the analyses. The cross-section data for 500 corn farmers was a subsample from the cost and returns survey conducted by the Bureau of Agricultural Statistics in 1983. The study basically used the economic surplus approach in measuring the equity implications of modern technology. Simple mean comparison, regression models and factor share analyses were also used. Results showed that researchers and policymakers alike had realized the potentials of improving corn productivity through technological development. Researchers focused not only on yield improvement but also on corn genetic material improvement particularly pest resistance. Technological development in corn led to increased welfare gains for the society. Small farmers being major consumers themselves absorbed part of the welfare gains in terms of consumer surplus in addition to the producers\' surplus from technological change. The strong linkage of the feed industry with the livestock industry also resulted in positive spill-over effects, which benefited not only the livestock producers but the consumers in general. Technological change not only contributed to increases in corn supply in the country but also stabilized prices and increased import substitution. Similarly, technological change showed very significant positive effects on labor use. The more important implication of the employment effects, however, was the increase in labor productivity resulting from technological change, thereby further improving equity in the rural areas. Thus, the principal impact of technological change in employment lay beyond the direct impact on farm employment but on the entire income streams generated by the new technology. Results of the study documented the positive benefits from technological change in corn emphasizing and rationalizing the need for increased research expenditures. The strong linkage of the corn industry with the livestock industry further amplified the benefits from increased corn productivity.

Three methods for lag estimation were used: simple, three-year average and Almon-polynomial lag. The Almon-polynomial lag in general gave more significant and refined coefficients. Corn area, production and yield showed general increases during the four decades. Increases, however, were due more to expansion in area planted rather than in changes in yield levels. Various government programs aimed at an increasing corn productivity were launched with each program learning from the experience of the other. Corn research efforts in the country increased through the years. Activities shifted from a developing downy mildew resistant varieties to developing more high-yielding and pest-resistant varieties. The study showed that in general, corn research investment need an average of ten years before returns in terms of sustained productivity changes were felt. Returns from research investment followed a cyclical pattern over time whereas returns to extension expenditures follow a bell shaped pattern reaching its peak five to six years after the investment was made. Significant returns from research investment, however, were obtained only when returns to extension expenditures were insignificant. Estimated IRR for research expenditure ranged from 29% to 48%.

The seemingly small number of farmers who mechanized their farm holdings was attributed to such factors as high cost of renting tractor and relatively small farm area. The traditional way of cultivating farms using draft animals had not yet been abandoned by the farmers. Diversification was not yet properly practiced by farmers in the surveyed area because the type of soil and topography of their farm holdings were suitable to rice production.

The study was conducted to 1) assess the extra solar radiation in rice fields and how this could be used profitably, 2) determine the available amount of solar radiation that could sustain normal growth processes in rice plants, and 3) determine the most appropriate time of planting the cover crop in relation to rice transplanting.

More detailed study was made on the vM2 plants. Exposures of 2 kR and 3kR resulted to vM1 variants with respect to leaf shape and growth rate, with Kinabakab being the most severely affected. In addition, 3 kR resulted to one vM1 variant of Kinabakab with some incomplete flowers. Possible causes of these observations were discussed. All variants in BNAS-51 and UPLB Acc.624 and some variants in Kinabakab reverted to normal leaf production and growth in vM2. The subject of recovery was discussed. One Kinabakab vM2 variant produced two secondary branches with variegated pigmentation and they were thought to be the result of plastid mutations and tissue rearrangements in the meristem. The radiation level of 3 kR reduced flowering duration in vM2. Observations on mortality and weevil resistance screening in vM2 were doubtful. Measurements made on quantitative characters in vM2 did not detect any significant deviation from normal characteristics as a result of mutagenic treatment and this was attributed to the strong influence the environment had on these traits and the smallness of the individual contributions of minor genes for a quantitative character. Significant differences between cultivars were, however, noted. Meiotic studies on vM2 showed all cultivars had a normal chromosome number of 2n = 90 except for some aneuploid cells. The controls in all cultivars exhibited meiotic irregularities such as laggards, multivalents, multiple metaphase plates and chromosome noncongression at the metaphase plate but these were more pronounced in Kinabakab and BNAS-51. No significant correlation between bivalent frequency and pollen fertility was detected in all cultivars. There was a general increase in multivalent and aneuploid frequencies and an accompanying decline in bivalent frequency and pollen viability with increase in radiation exposure. This was ascribed to chromosome stickiness and chromosome aberrations, notably translocations, as a result of radiation treatment. Changes in other meiotic irregularities like laggard, multiple metaphase plate and chromosome noncongression frequencies were negligible. It was concluded that 2 kR was sufficient to generate genetic changes in some sweet potato cultivars.

This was especially true when the depth of groundwater table from the soil surface equal to or less than 47 cm. The areas located at the middle and farthest from the surrounding flooded paddy fields planted to rice exhibited a good prospect for diversified cropping during the dry season because of the trend of favorable soil moisture conditions at the rooting zone in the area. This implied that flooding the surrounding rice fields required minimal or even no irrigation in growing upland crops in the adjacent lots, provided, however, that the average depth of groundwater table stayed at 67-75 m depth below soil surface.

Data were taken from a benchmark information survey of the Philippine Tobacco Research and Training Center (PTRTC) during the crop year 1978-1979. These were analyzed with the conventional farm management and Cobb-Douglas production function analysis. Out of the 1008 farm operators surveyed in Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Abra and La Union, only 898 farms were included in the analysis. The farm size stratification was 0.50 ha and below, 0.51-1.00, 1.01-1.50, 1.51 ha and above. The smallest farm size group produced the highest yield and gross income per hectare, 1198 kg and P6987, respectively. Yield per hectare among provinces was statistically similar. The average rate of input use was inversely related to farm size. Small farms used more inputs per hectare than large farms. Among the provinces, Abra farm utilized the least amount of all kinds of input except labor. The comparable yield of Abra farms with the other provinces despite low input use was partly attributed to the inherent productivity of the soil. Larger farmers were more efficient than the smaller farmers. Large farms reduced costs by spreading labor costs and other expenses over more land and output, hence, the economies of scale prevailed. Production function analysis showed that farm area, man-labor days, fertilizers, operating capital expenses and quantity of firewood significantly influenced yield of the farms. Area planted had the greatest influence on yield. Farm size, 1.51 ha and above, was allocatively more efficient than the other three smaller farm size groups. The allocation of inputs in flue-cured tobacco farms was inefficient. Land and fertilizers were underutilized while man-labor, operating capital expenses and firewood were over utilized. Adjusting the output use can increase farm income and profit.

The subtreatments were control (no fertilizer); 120-90-50 kg/ha N-P2O5-K2O from inorganic fertilizer; 80, 100, 120 and 140 kg/ha N using ipil-ipil leaves; and 80, 100, 120 and 140 kg/ha N using ipil-ipil leaves plus 90 kg/ha P2O5 and 50 kg/ha K2O from inorganic sources. Results showed nonsignificant effects of time of incorporation of ipil-ipil leaves, applied alone or in combination with inorganic fertilizers, on the height of plants at 30, 70 and 90 days after transplanting, leaf length, width, area, lamina-midrib ratio, specific leaf weight and quality index. However, cured leaf yield was significantly affected. Application of the fertilizer combinations at 14 days before transplanting produced the highest cured leaf yield of 2.06 t/ha. The lowest yield was observed when the fertilizers were applied 21 days before transplanting with a mean 1.73 t/ha. On the varying levels of ipil-ipil leaves, applied alone or in combination with inorganic fertilizers, significant effects were noted on leaf length, lamina-midrib ratio, specific leaf weight, cured leaf yield and quality index of tobacco. The highest values on these parameters were observed on plants applied with 120-90-50 kg/ha N- P2O5- K2O but was not significantly different with those applied with 100-120 kg/ha N using ipil-ipil leaves with or without P and K.

The optimal solution determined the optimal number, location and production capacity of each of four different wood processing plants (veneer mill, veneer and plywood mill, sawmill and pulp and paper mill) which should be set up and operated so that (a) log transport costs from source areas to the processing plants were minimized while having an optimal allocation of the plants into the log sources and the various log grains in them and (b) total establishment cost of all processing plants and total product manufacturing cost were minimized while considering the economies of scale associated with different plant sizes and meeting demand levels for specific products. The insights provided by the study and the experience from the model indicated that the degree of realism incorporated to the input data was very important to a model intended for real world application. The results obtained showed that the optimal solution favored the establishment of huge processing complexes each containing in some cases two different sizes of the same plant type in processing center choices comparatively closer to log source areas with abundant log supplies.

The patterns were tissue specific; the different tissues examined, namely, eyes, liver, heart and skeletal muscle had different expression of their LDH isozymes. The LDH patterns resolved for milkfish were products of LDH gene loci A, B  and C. The A and B subunits were found in all tissues; A4 was predominant in the skeletal muscle while B4 was predominant in the heart muscle.

Volume of products the middlemen handled in one week varied considerably. Volume of peanut handled increased in the following ascending order: agent, retailer, wholesaler-retailer, assembler-wholesaler, and wholesaler. In mungo the order was: retailer, wholesaler-retailer, and wholesaler. Wholesalers were the major outlets for both mungo and peanut. Gross margins of middlemen were generally higher in mungo than in peanut. In the regression models developed for gross margins, buying price, selling price, volume of product handled, total cost and operating capital as significant explanatory variables accounted for the variations in the gross margins of the middlemen. Ten marketing channels were identified in peanut and six in mungo. Channel VI (farmer to wholesaler to consumer) for peanut and Channel I (farmer to wholesaler-retailer to retailer) and Channel II (farmer to wholesaler to retailer) for mungo were the most efficient on account of their corresponding low gross margins. The generally high marketing margins among identified channels resulting in increased consumer\'s price was attributed to the duplication of services.

Ten trials were conducted for eggs, four for nauplii and three each for zoeae and myses. All eggs and larvae used in one trial were taken from a single spawner. Eggs and nauplii survived the sudden change of temperature and salinity (from ambient to experimental) but the zoeae and myses did not.

Its framework consisted of six major sequential phases, namely, (1) geomorphologic and hydrologic characterization and mapping of the river basin, (2) analysis of the potentials of the river basin and societal needs, (3) stratification of the planning unit into land suitability units, (4) analysis of land-use strategies, (5) decision-making analysis (optimization modeling), and (6) implementation, evaluation and feedback. An integrated inventory technique was adopted in the geomorphologic characterization of the study area. Goal programming (GP) was formulated with 77 mathematical output goal equations and 33 constraint equations. A tableau was prepared for its computerization using the MPSX packaged program of the IBM 370 computer. An optimal solution was generated by the computer, which disclosed 59 products, 9 services, and 34 management strategies out of the proposed 77 output goals and 74 alternative management strategies, respectively. The feasible products and services represented a good mixture of benefits for the economic development of the basin, the province and the region. Similarly the feasible management strategies typify a good set of production strategies that could ensure effective production of goods/services and protection of the natural environment for the sustenance of uses of the land. A cost overrun sensitivity analysis was done on the model and the goal achievement level, area allocation and activity range of some products and management strategies were sensitive to an increase in the budget. The products and strategies under intensive management scheme increased in achievement levels and area allocation, respectively, and those under moderate management scheme decreased. On the other hand, the profitability of the project as a whole decreased. The application of GP to optimize conflicting land uses in a river basin once again proved its usefulness as a decision-making tool. With realistic technological coefficients on product yields and goal levels of the output goal variables, GP ensured a workable tool for decision making. Its susceptibility to postoptimality analysis proved its flexibility to changes that might be brought about by uncertainties in plan formulation and implementation. On the whole, GP was a comprehensive and significant optimization method. As a planning unit, a river basin was ideal for a multi-objective, multisectoral land-use planning not only because of its definable boundary and big resource potentialities but also its being emphasized by law.',NULL,NULL,'Diaz, Norman T.','ABACA, ABACA, F1 HYBRIDS, F1 HYBRIDS, DISEASE RESISTANCE, DISEASE RESISTANCE, PLANT VIRUSES, PLANT VIRUSES',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2896,'2021-09-01 07:44:52','2021-09-01 07:44:52','Communication flow and utilization of agricultural engineering technology in two rice-farming communities of Nueva Ecija.','1998-09-01','Data for this study were taken from 228 rice farmers in Barangay Mataas na Kahoy, General Natividad and Barangay Sibul, Talavera both in Nueva Ecija, 14 extension workers, sales representatives of commercial agencies dealing in Agricultural Engineering Technology (AET) and five sources of AET.

The nutrient uptake in the plants increased as the amount of nitrogen applied was increased. As regards the percent concentrations of the above nutrients in the monocrops and intercrops, significant differences were found in the plant roots, stems and leaves except in the mungbean pods.

Two use-prediction models were developed using the general linear models procedure involving the following socio-economic-demographic characteristics of the user population on a town basis: population, education, income, residence type, sex, age, distance of town from MBG site and expenditures made for the recreation package. The first model was generated directly. The second equation used the principal component analysis method prior to model development.

The data were gathered through personal interviews with 80 abaca fibercraft manufacturers and 30 traders. The nature and degree of market competition for finished abaca fibercrafts were analyzed both at the domestic and export market. It was found that the domestic market was fairly competitive. There were many small local suppliers and traders and not one of them was large enough to control a dominant share of the market. Entry into the domestic market was relatively easy and that product differentiation was slight or moderate. Analysis of the concentration ratios showed that each producer-exporter and trader-exporter handled a small portion of the market. Hence, a competitive market existed at the export market. Manufacturers and traders competed with other sellers in the world market both in terms of quantity (volume handled) and quality of the sold product. Barriers in the export market generally took the form of superior entrepreneurship, strict quality control and high skill requirement. Product differentiation of the producer-exporters was largely backed-up by sales promotion. Manufacturers determined output or total supply based on the amount or volume of abaca fibercrafts the buyers ordered or demanded. This was attributed to the difficulty to forecast the types of articles that must be produced since most buyers preferred their own style/design. Mark-up pricing was the normal practice of the manufacturers and traders. Pricing efficiency was generally good. The analysis with respect to marketing margins showed that none of the traders earned excess profits. Handling operation of the firms was simple.

Ammoniated CBM contained lower levels of dry matter (DM), crude fiber (CF), nitrogen free extract (NFE) and phosphorus but contained higher levels of crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE) ash and calcium than nonammoniated CBM. Ammoniation also decreased the tannic acid level but not the urease activity of the meal.

It followed a comprehensive and integrated conceptual framework. It related seed cotton yield on one hand, with farmer and technician characteristics, farmer-technician interaction, farmer desire to comply, farmer compliance behavior, and intervening variables on the other. The farmer\'s characteristics considered important contributors to seed cotton yields were: the farmer\'s level of knowledge of the technician\'s recommendations on cotton-growing, his level of education, degree of exposure to media and the number of household members helping on the farm. The amount of total expenses per hectare for cotton-growing was a significant determinant of seed cotton yield. Increasing size of cotton area had a negative effect on yield among the farmers, given the sizes of their total farms and the availability of resources. The number of hours spent on the job by the technician was associated with the level of seed cotton yield of the supervised farmers. The relevance of technician education was likewise observed. For successful cotton growing, adequacy of irrigation was an important prerequisite. Inability to irrigate as prescribed, all other things equal, lead to a significant reduction in seed cotton yield. The need for farmers to follow strictly the prescribed planting dates was also highlighted. From the results obtained, it was concluded that the human factor had a bearing on the yield performance of cotton farmers. The study had empirical evidence that farmers who complied with their technician\'s recommendations got better yields than those who did not. The suitability of the prescribed technology and the feasibility of the farmers attaining the yield potentials demonstrated in research verifications was confirmed with farmer-based data from a well-dispersed representative sample. Throughout the study a managerial perspective was assumed. Thus, this study went beyond the scope of contemporary literature on adoption and extension education and focuses on farmer yield seen as the physical output of the technology transfer process - as the relevant variable in understanding farmer and technician characteristics, adoption and performance. A number of policy implications based on the results of the study were presented. It was hoped that further research would be undertaken following the integrated framework of this study and its focus on yield performance.

The external cost of extraction in terms of declining water table and increasing pumping cost was estimated in two steps. The first step estimated a linear regression equation reflecting the demand and supply forces, and the second step introduced the estimated coefficients into an equation that presented the externality as a function of the marginal private cost of pumping. The user cost was estimated as the cost of replacing depleted groundwater resource at some future date. It was estimated by getting the difference between the present value of the marginal private cost of the substitute or replacement technology and the present value of the marginal private cost of existing technology. The results showed that there was a divergence between social and private cost of extracting water for irrigation using STWs in Central Luzon. The external effects estimated as the cost imposed on others, i.e., externality cost, and the intertemporal consideration of scarcity premium, i.e., user cost, made the divergence. The study estimated the marginal externality cost at P899.55/ha per year and the marginal user cost at P534.55/ha per year. Together, P1,434.10/ha per year, which was about 24% of the marginal private cost of extracting water using STW, represented the divergence between marginal private cost and marginal social cost. For Tarlac, the aggregate unpaid cost of STW operation was estimated at P48, 546.00 per year.

The experiments evaluated the efficacy of inoculation and compost applications in supplementing the fertilizer requirements and economic viability of sugarcane variety PHIL 8013 in a Guimbalon clay loam soil (pH 5.1, 1.76% OM/N, 21 ppm P and 52 ppm K). Bacterial population as determined by most probable number (MPN) and nitrogen fixation through acetylene reduction assay (ARA) in the roots and in the rhizosphere was observed in treatments without inoculation. ARA in the roots was inhibited by N application while high N application increased ARA in the rhizosphere. Higher ARA was observed in zero-N treatments in the roots while a lower ARA was demonstrated in the rhizosphere. High N applications inhibited the number of mycorrhizal spores in the rhizosphere. Inoculation reduced ARA in treatments with compost and fertilization in the roots and in the rhizosphere. Inoculation and application of fertilizers and compost at 2 t/ha stimulated spore formation of VA mycorrhiza in the rhizosphere. Cane and sugar yields were not affected by combination of inoculation and fertilizer application but were significantly affected by N fertilizer application. The lack of response to P fertilizer application could be attributed to adequate soil P (21 ppm). Inoculation plus one-half of the recommended rate of N significantly increased the number of millable and weight of sugarcane stalks.

The Department of Environment and Natural Resources\' (DENR)  Community Forestry Program and Haribon Palawan\'s Community Development Program for Environmental Protection (CDEP) were analyzed in terms of context, input, process and output using Stuart\'s (1991) CIPO evaluation model as a framework. Results indicated that the two organizations had no clearly defined communication policies and strategies for their environmental programs. The communication strategies developed by the management staff, community organizers and community cooperators were based on the activities subsumed under the different program components. These components included community organizing, technical capability building, income generation and networking for CFP; and community organizing, education and community mobilization for CDEP. The communication media (interpersonal reinforced by print, broadcast and audiovisual media), methods (individual, group/sectoral and organizational) and approaches (persuasion, information, motivation and education) adapted by the two organizations were almost the same. However, more communication approaches were developed by GO than NGO because CFP had more components and was wider than CDEP. Findings also showed that in preplanning and planning phases, the kinds and number of activities conducted in the different communication processes by GO were varied and greater than the NGO. In implementing and postimplementing phases, it was the reverse. Except for needs assessment and community information materials preparation and production, the similarities in information seeking, information dissemination, formative evaluation and connectivity tended to offset the differences. As a consequence, positive perceptions of the community cooperators on environmental programs were revealed for both GO and NGO. Four factors classified the perception  under each program. These were participation, economic benefits accruing from forest utilization and organizational concerns, sustainability and role of community for CFP; and participation and provision of alternative economic sources, organizational concerns and environmental awareness, education and values formation and preservation and its effect for CDEP. These factors reflected the elements and directions of the environmental programs. Furthermore, wide range of participation of the NGO and GO community cooperators particularly in the implementation phase of the two programs was evident. With the growing concern on environmentalism and proliferation of environmental programs, the context, input, and process of preplanning, planning, implementing, and postimplementing communication strategies should be given due consideration to enhance the attainment of the desired output.

Abaca mosaic incidence increased with time and was the highest in Amguhan. Apparent infection rates of the disease were 0.03, 0.02 and 0.05 plants per month for Sapa 1, Sapa2 and Amguhan, respectively. The disease increased 1.8 times or almost doubled in 12 months after a one-time unsustained eradication activity. A 3.9 average of abaca mosaic regrowths per hill was observed as a result of unsuccessful and incomplete hill eradication of abaca mosaic-diseased abaca hill or mat. Apparently, unsustained eradication did not guarantee effective disease control. Annual percent disease increases were 8.8 and 16.07% for Sapa and Amguhan, respectively. With these rates, the likelihood that abaca plantations in the two barangays would be wiped out was high. Weather factors had no direct effect on disease incidence. The random movements of the various aphid species acting as vectors of abaca mosaic resulted in the patternless disease spread in the experimental sites. The disease had affected 212 ha in Sapa and 201.8 ha in Amguhan corresponding to a total yield loss of 8,050.14 and 7,684.22 kg, equivalent to P144,902.52 and P138,315.90, respectively. Rates of increase in prevalence were 0.06 and 0.04 farms per month for Sapa and Amguhan, respectively. With these rates, the remaining unaffected abaca plantations in the two barangays would be all infected in three years time. Eradication activities should be fast enough to keep pace with the disease and complete eradication of all possible sources of inocula; periodic inspection and surveys are necessary to attain success. Trapped aphids in Baybay, Leyte were Aphis gossypii Glover, A. spiraecola Patch, Ceratovacuna lanigera Zehntner, Greenidea formosana (Maki), Pentalonia nigronervosa Coquerel and Toxoptera odinae (van der Goot). Only alates and apterae of P. nigronervosa were infesting abaca plants in the sites. Abaca mosaic incidence was not correlated with the total number of aphids and number of alate aphids per plant, but highly correlated with the number of trapped aphids in the area. Abaca mosaic disease incidence increased progressively as the number of trapped aphids increased. Among the weather factors, temperature and relative humidity showed a profound effect on the number of alate aphids per plant and number of trapped aphids, respectively. Wind velocity showed significant influence on abaca mosaic incidence. Temperature in the sites seemed to favor multiplication and wing bud formation of aphids. Wind velocity also favored aphid take-off and enhanced movements of alate aphids in the different abaca plantations. Severity levels of abaca mosaic significantly reduced the tensile strenght, biomass yield, fiber yield, plant height and stalk diameter of abaca plants. Abaca mosaic disease affected all stages of plant growth in the field. Relationships between disease severity and tensile strength, total fiber yield, biomass yield, plant height, stem diameter and total gross income were described by the following equations: Y = 33.02 - 2.30X, Y = 414.31 - 47.52X, Y = 13.71 - 0.489X, Y = 587.28 - 28.81X, Y = 52.58 - 4.16X and Y = 15703 - 2120.02X, respectively. Coefficients of determination (R2) values for all the parameters regressed were all highly significant at 1% level of significance. Abaca mosaic severity levels significantly reduced the gross income of farmers. As disease intensity increased, total gross income decreased. A per hectare annual loss of P26,184.06 or a regional annual loss of P977,825, 391.90 would occur if abaca mosaic affected the abaca plantations at severity level 5.',NULL,NULL,'Jose, Aurora S.','watershed, Caliraya watershed$zLaguna, watershed$xenvironmental changes$xcommunity development',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2018-07-26-02_ab_55612.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(2910,'2021-09-01 07:44:52','2021-09-01 07:44:52','Communication analysis of three DENR approaches to contract reforestation in Northern Samar, Philippines.','2021-09-01','This study aimed to determine the role of communication in influencing the participation and acquisition or development of environmental knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of the three groups of contractors in selected family, community and corporate contract reforestation projects in Northern Samar, Philippines. The communication variables--communication structure, type of communication (formal and informal) and channels used, communication resources employed and the frequency of communication contact between the DENR field staff and selected family heads, community/people\'s organization and corporate contractors in Northern Samar, Philippines-- were described, compared and analyzed using the case study method. The contractors\' rate and levels of participation in CRP activities, environmental knowledge, attitudes and skills/practices acquired from their involvement with the projects (AKAP) and those those derived from prepared checklists (CKAP) were determined, compared and analyzed as project success indicators. The respondents of the corporate approach, Samar Center for Rural Education and Development (SACRED), consistently topped in the participation, AKAP and CKAP indicators. Not discounting a confluence of other factors, this was attributed to the use of both the formal and informal types of communication (compared to the informal type alone used in the family and Dao Aqua-Agro People\'s Cooperative, Inc. (DAAP) community contractors), the stakeholders\' high educational attainments, organization\'s environmental orientation and track record as DENR project contractor. Although the communication channels used (print, broadcast and interpersonal media) and the resources (both human and financial) employed were the same for the corporate and community contractors, participation, AKAP and CKAP levels of SACRED and DAAP were extremely opposite, with SACRED having the edge. The family head contractors\' edge over DAAP in the participation, knowledge and practices domains were attributed more to their farming and fishing backgrounds and to their longer period of involvement with the CRP. Except for DAAP\'s development of more positive environmental attitudes than the family head contractors, it was lowest in all three project success indicators. On the other hand, frequency of communication contact did not seem to influence DAAP\'s levels of participation, AKAP and CKAP because the respondents reportedly had more frequent communication contact with the project staff, yet they ranked last to SACRED and the family head contractors on these measures. Aside from the lack of awareness and clear understanding of the project\'s rationale and environmental benefits as a serious problem, the existence of dummy contracts and the lack of commitment, sincerity and honesty of some DENR staff and family head contractors were likewise seen as major problems. Dummy contracts in family head reforestation approach were either consummated because of the absence of horizontal communication for lack of organization, their separation and isolation in time and space, or the presence of horizontal communication but with mutually agreeing and consenting parties (family head contractors, private individuals and DENR employees and field staff) to consummate and accomplish the fraudulent dummy transactions. To these problems, extensive environmental information, education and communication activities, advocacy campaigns using both the formal and informal communication types and the use of a mix of mass media and the interactive and participatory interpersonal channels to all project stakeholders were recommended. In addition, conscienticizing techniques and values formation/reorientation were also suggested so that the DENR staff, contractors and other stakeholders will develop commitment, sincerity and honesty not only in discharging their project-related tasks but also in fulfilling their roles as keepers of the country\'s patrimony and as stewards of God\'s creation. Furthermore, establishment of communication units in DENR offices managed by qualified, capable, committed, honest and sincere multidisciplinary teams that will work through collaboration, networking and advocacy with other formal, cohesive and stable organizations was recommended.',NULL,NULL,'Arroyo, Esther Joy N.','lettuce$xnutritive value x phytochemical content x microbial content, Lactuca sativa, upland kangkong$xnutritive value x phytochemical content x microbial content, Ipomoea aquatica, Nutrition',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/Communication analysis of three DENR approaches_ab_55608.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(2911,'2021-09-01 07:44:52','2021-09-01 07:44:52','Epidemiology of wilt disease of coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) in Socorro, Oriental Mindoro.','1999-09-01','Past and present occurrences and severity of \"Socorro wilt\" in the municipality of Socorro, Oriental Mindoro were mapped out. The main intensity of attack was concentrated in six adjacent barangays. The disease also occurred sporadically in other six barangays with a \"jump spread\" pattern of spatial spread. The geographical range of the disease increased to approximately 12 km radius from the coconut farm where it was first spotted in the early 1960s. Regression analysis using two models of disease spreads was used to examine the relationship of disease incidence to distance from the source. The relationship between disease incidence (Y) and distance (X) from the inoculum source was given as Y = 0.49X-1.25 for Gregory\'s model and Y = 0.35e-0.33X for Kiyosawa and Shiyomi\'s model. The spatial spread was better explained by Gregory\'s model. The disease progress curves depicted a negative exponential curve. The disease progression was likewise examined by regression analysis using two disease growth models. Both simple interest disease and logistic growth models explained the increase of the disease, however, it was better explained by simple interest growth model. Infection rate of \"Socorro wilt\" was estimated as 0.00452-0.06029/unit per year according to simple interest disease growth model while apparent infection rate ranged from 0.156 to 0.389/unit per year based on logistic model. Coconut age level, relative dominance of Imperata cylindrica, Mikania cordata and Paspalum conjugatum, incidence of Oryctes rhinoceros, soil acidity, exchangeable bases and textural grade of soil affected the development of the disease.

Data were gathered from 94 family contractors, 101 members/officers of 17 community contractors [9 nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and 8 local  government units (LGUs)], and 90 laborers hired by the community contractors. Data gathered through personal interview and field visitations were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square, t-test and Pearson Product Moment Correlation. The findings showed that majority of the family contractor-respondents highly participated in the implementation of the project, while only less than one-third of the community contractors indicated high participation. Reasons for low and zero participation were (1) some members participated as subcontrators and paid laborers so they participated only when they were invited and (2) members were not informed about the project. It also showed that majority (70 %) of the  family contractors involved other members of the family and practiced the \"bayanihan system\" in implementing the Contract Reforestation Project (CRP). In contrast, only one-third of association/LGU members were invited and consequently actively participated in the implementation of CRP. Other associations/LGUs invited participation from members only as subcontractors, and still others failed to inform their members guidelines on CRP implementation. While almost all family contractors received financial benefits from CRP amounting to P4,000.00/ha in the first year of implementation, inequality in sharing financial benefits was very evident among community contractors. Only 78 % of the members of the community contractors received financial benefits but implementation costs were lower than that of the family contractors. For the daily wage members, payment ranged only from P50.00 to P80.00/day or from P2,000.00 to P2,800.00/ha for those who subcontracted. Only 4 out of the 17 community contractors reported sharing considerable benefits to the general membership. Four other community contractors did not or were not able to share any benefits to the members. The three major problems cited by both family and community contractors were (1) financial matters; (2) natural calamities, i.e., long drought and fire occurrence and (3) unsuitability of suggested species to the area. Majority of the socioeconomic factors hypothesized to affect level of participation had significant and negative relationship to participation. These were sex, household income, educational attainment and occupation. Acccessibility from residence/office of operation, as a physical factor, showed a negative relationship with participation.

Eggs of the tobacco bug had an incubation period of 6.0 + - 0.08 days and 98.81% hatchability in the laboratory. These were laid singly and inserted diagonally in the tissues of succulent stems, petioles and midribs but the injury caused had no significance. The nymphal stage underwent five instars in 13.8 days when reared on newly hatched cutworm on excised tobacco leaf. The nymphal period was seven days longer when the nymph was reared on excised tobacco leaf only.  Percent survival, oviposition period, fecundity and longevity were greatly enhanced in bugs reared continuously on cutworm. With cutworm as its prey on tabacco, the life cycle of the bug was completed in 23.07 days. Potted and field tobacco at early to rapid vegetative stages exposed from 7 to 15 days to a population density of 10-30 nymphs or adult bugs inside mylar cages, did not manifest the characteristic damage of the bug claimed by other workers. The number of bugs simply diminished and no second generation nymphs were produced. Confining ten bugs only on the whorl and on individual, very young leaves gave similar results. The 0.25 sq cm surface of a young bud exposed to individual nymph or adult bug confined on a clip-on cage did not exhibit any sign of injury until full expansion. Induced transmission of CMV and TMV diseases through oviposition or feeding of the bug on potted plants at 25 DAT also yielded negative results. Population density of the bug increased with the growth stage of tobacco whether planted early or late in the season. Rate of increase was lower on early crop and accelerated on the later crops. A remarkable behavior of the bug to congregate on the upper parts of the plant was recorded. As predators, both nymphs and adult bugs highly preferred the newly hatched cutworm as prey. Consumption of the different instars of the bug on the preferred prey increased with age. The bug\'s efficiency as a predator of cutworm induced on tobacco planted early or later ranged from 97 to 100%. Other sources of food like live or dead insects and other arthropods stuck on the surface of the crop did not affect the efficiency of the bug.The bug was present in the provinces growing tobacco in the country. But two other mirid species were noted. One was encountered only on the crop in Misamis Oriental and Cebu where it was the most abundant bug. The bigger species seemed to appear only later in the tobacco season in Batac, Ilocos  Norte. The vegetable, upo or bottlegourd (Lagenaria siceraria:Cucurbitaceae) and the weed, Tantandok (Cleome viscose: Cleomaceae), were determined as alternate hosts of the bug in Batac and the vicinities. No parasitoid was recorded from the egg and postembryonic stages of the bug. All eight identified predators were spiders under the families Oxyopidae, Thomisidae and Araneidae. The lynx spider, Oxyopes javanus Thorell, was the most prevalent and probably the bug\'s most harmful natural enemy. Methamidophos was determined to be very toxic to the bug or the bug was too sensitive to the insecticide under the conditions of the test. Its LD50 of 9.19 ppm was 204 times its recommended field rate of 1875-2000 ppm against the aphid, M. persicae.

Data were gathered using a self-administered questionnaire for technicians and an interview schedule for farmers. Frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation were used to describe the findings. The technicians were aware of the organizational structure of the projects studied. At both levels, funds were perceived as barely enough to finance/support the projects\' activities. Sometimes, however, the funds were adequately provided and released on time. The technicians noted that every farming systems team was adequately provided with motorcycles and tools. The teams comprised of four members, namely; the Farm Management Technician (FMT), Home Management Technician (HMT), Livestock Inspector (L.I.) and the team leader for every municipality. However, their number was barely enough to carry out the projects\' activities in the municipality. Even if they were prepared and equipped with the proper training and skills to better implement the project, the ensuing problems were not acted upon immediately. The knowledge level of respondents in both levels was average. Almost all of the technicians believed that the DA regional office, administrative personnel were supportive of the project, although not to the fullest. Both levels of respondents used mediated communication such as pamphlets, brochure and radio. However, the farmers preferred radio first and the pamphlets least. The respondents used group discussion, farm and home visits, informal discussion, farmers\' classes, field tours and field days as interpersonal method of communication. The feedback channel was through the technicians to the farmers. The frequency of providing feedback was one to three times a week. Feedback did not necessarily referred to research results but to FSA-related messages for discrimination to farmers as partners for agricultural development. Aside from these the farmers also provided the DA technicians with information, findings and problems encountered in the field for proper action by the technical experts in the DA. The communication pattern or communication flow established in the region started from informal meetings initiated by the team leader of the Field Operation Team (FOT). The output of said meeting was submitted to the DA technicians. The DA technicians and the team leader analyzed the output and planned for a community assembly/farmers class, and informed the barangay captain of the plans for the community. In response, the barangay captain notified the farmers in the barangay about the plans through the barangay councilmen in every sitio or zone. At the farmers\' level, the communication pattern or communication flow was from their fellow farmers and local leaders. While resting from farm work in the afternoon, they exchanged opinions regarding their farming needs and problems. They communicated these with other members of the household, and lastly to the technician assigned in the barangay. FSA messages took one to three days to reach the provincial office and four to seven days to reach the regional office. Most of the time, these messages were followed-up personally for quicker action.

The field survey was conducted from February to March 1997. Among the specific objectives of the study were to: 1) present typical corn farm production structure, 2) ascertain the appropriateness of experimental yields in measuring potential yields of corn farms, 3) estimate the level of technical efficiencies of farms, 4) examine factors related to the level of technical efficiencies, 5) analyze the cost of technical inefficiencies and 6) examine the possible existence of allocative inefficiencies among farms. The average land productivity of sample farms was 2.73 mt/ha, about 30% higher than the regional average but only 45% of potential yield. There were large differences in yields across samples as indicated by a 46% coefficient of yield variation. A seed-fertilizer type of innovation was the set of technological recommendations introduced by the government in the study area. Most followed the recommended one-bag-per-hectare seeding rate. On average, farmers underfertilized their farms by about 13-19 kg N, 10 kg P and 19-37 kg K. The adoption rate of other production practices like listed planting, weeding and drying was high. Factor shares analysis showed a current input-biased corn farming since current input share was about 31% compared to only 12% for rice farming. The 43% rate of return to land was similar to rice\'s 40%. Although the absolute values were different, the corn farmer\'s income share of the total value of production was the same with rice\'s. Of the four conventional inputs used in the estimation of the average trans-log production function, only nitrogen and labor input elasticities proved significant. For the various dummies included in the function, only those on pesticide, tractor, detasseling and Cargill seeds were significant. The Battese and Coelli (1995) model of a stochastic frontier production function was used to analyze technical efficiency. Simultaneous estimation of a frontier production function of trans-log form with a linear inefficiency effects model showed that the average technical efficiency index of the sample farms was 0.47. This was quite similar to the ratio of actual yield and potential yield of 0.45 cited previously. It also showed that variables related to schooling, family labor and other income sources positively affected the level of technical efficiency. However, nearness to road/town centers and land ownership had negative impact on technical efficiency. The variables on loan availment, extension visit and land size did not influence technical efficiency. A stochastic frontier cost function patterned after Battese and Coelli (1992) model was estimated to quantify the cost of being technically inefficient. Results showed that, on average, the cost of technical inefficiency index was about 0.20. This was not so different from the 0.17 difference in actual and potential nonland cost per unit output. A nonminimum cost function was estimated to determine the possible existence of allocative inefficiency among farms. The analysis showed that of the four input prices, only the wage rate shadow price divergence parameter was significant. This might point to the possible presence of allocative inefficiency. Since measurement of the wage rate variable did not include meals, further investigation might show contrasting result. However, even if this truly existed, the difference in the observed and shadow cost function was only less than 2%. The study concluded that the productivity of Philippine corn farms could still be improved by minimizing technical inefficiency. Significant breakthrough must occur to increase the level of technical efficiency dramatically to more than 50%.

Specifically, it evaluated the following: the social impacts of the ISFP through the adoption of policy changes by the participants, the ecological impacts of the projects as perceived by the community and as reflected by the forest conservation measures adopted by the participants, the economic impacts of the ISFP, the participants\' problems that had affected the implementation of the program, the efficiency and financial worth of the projects in view of the participants and the implementing agency, the efficiency and economic worth of the projects, the ISFP in terms of equity among the participants, and come up with policy recommendations based on the results of the study. The data were gathered from two selected ISF projects in La Union and Ilocos Sur. The respondents were ISF participants, 74 nonparticipants, 18 implementors, and key informants. The ISFP was effective both in social and ecological aspects but not in the economic aspect of the program. There was contentment among the participants in terms of tenure of the ISF farms and the way the ISFP was implemented. This pointed out that the participants had adopted the policy change and that a wide area of development and participation among the participants were expected in the future. Likewise, the ISFP had positive ecological impacts as reflected by (a) the changes in land-use systems from kaingin to permanent cropping system with high multiple cropping index and a random mix cropping patterns; (b) decongestion of population pressure by strong tenure of property, (c) the positive changes on the vegetation of the farms through diversity of up to 15 species; (d) the positive changes in the productiveness of the farms coupled by the adoption of soil and water conservation measures, better pest and diseases prevention, and better tree protection. Until the completion of the study, the implementation of the ISFP as a national policy to alleviate poverty and improve the lives of the upland farmers economically had not created any positive development impact on the farmers in the study sites. T-test on the indicators of economic impacts used showed no appreciable difference between the participants and the nonparticipants during a decade of ISFP implementation. The participants viewed the ISFP as efficient in the two study sites. The La Union project was more efficient (BCR=51.97) than the Ilocos Sur project (BCR=6.78). Moreover, both projects were profitable from the view of the society but not from the view of the implementing agency. The net present worth of La Union project was P3,229.012.96, which was higher than the Ilocos Sur project with a present worth of P203,230.47 at 12% rate of interest. Also, La Union project was more efficient (BCR=3.63) than Ilocos Sur project (BCR=1.12) at 2% discount rate.

The characteristics of the conidia in culture did not differ from those produced on naturally infected leaves except for their length. Conidia were longer in culture than those formed on naturally infected leaves. Conidia were hyaline, multiseptate (1 to 17 septa), obclavate-cylindric, straight to slightly curved with smooth walls, subtruncate bases and subobtuse to subacute tips. They were borne at the apices of the conidiophores. They ranged in size from 1.35 to 4.95 x 29.34 to 122.94 u. Conidiophores had zero to four septate, were light to dark brown, straight to curved, slightly geniculate, rarely branched and with slight to indistinct spore scars at the narrow tips. They ranged from 1.60 to 5.94 x 7.01 to 69.94 u. Conidiophores in naturally infected leaves were in fascicles arising from a stroma while in artificial media conidiophores were single and merely extended mycelial threads bearing conidia. On potato dextrose agar, the different isolates showed slight differences in colony color and diameter, number spores produced and other growth characteristics while on different culture media, Quezon 5 isolate exhibited differences in colony diameter, number of conidia produced, colony color and other growth characteristics. The causal fungus was identified as Cercospora timorensis Cooke based on the morphological characteristics of the conidia and the conidiophores. Inoculation by dusting first with carborundum before rubbing the inoculum with the thumb and forefinger hastened the appearance of symptoms.  Three- to four-week-old inoculum also produced symptoms earlier on inoculated plants. This inoculum age coincided with the abundant production of spores by the fungus.

Two sampling techniques (sweep net and actual counts) were also evaluated. There were nine class/orders of arthropods observed in the different cropping systems: Arachnida, Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera-Heteroptera, Hemiptera-Homoptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera Odonata and Orthoptera. Order Coleoptera had the highest number of families and species while Hemiptera-Homoptera had the highest in terms of percentage number of species. Relative abundance of arthropod fauna was similar in cotton monoculture and the various cotton based cropping systems. In terms of crop stage, the plants had significantly higher density of arthropods at squaring stage than at bolling stage. In addition, planting of cotton on a later date harbored a significantly higher density of arthropods although earlier planting showed a more diverse fauna than later planting. The diversity and density of insect pest and natural enemies were not influenced by crop diversity. However, transient species were significantly high in C + Tm + Tb + Gr cropping system. Insect pest and transient species density were significantly high during the squaring stage of the crop while natural enemies were predominant during the flowering stage. Early planting and bolling stage of the crop showed a significantly high index of diversity indicating a similar kind of species present for both planting dates and growth stages of cotton but low insect population. Seed cotton yield was highest in both Cm and C + Tm cropping systems. Significantly low yield was obtained in crops without insect control suggesting pest problem as the greatest contributory to yield reduction. More individual insect population were recorded using actual counts than the sweep net method. However, net sweeping had greater number of insect family and species at earlier stage of the corn than the actual count. Moreover, the actual method was more efficient in sampling leafhoppers than the sweep net method as indicated by lower coefficient of variability.

This study evaluated the factors that led to the adoption of these agroforestry systems and their ensuing environmental and socioeconomic impacts on the community. Data were gathered through field experiments, survey, field visitation, and evaluation of individual agroforestry farms. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used in data analysis. Findings revealed the capacity of the two agroforestry systems to protect and conserve the upland environment as evidenced by reduced surface runoff and soil erosion, improved soil physical and chemical properties, soil nutrient buildup and better microclimate for growth, and development of agroforestry crops. The productivity and sustainability of payoh (rice terraces), a subcomponent of the Ifugao indigenous agroforestry system, was linked with the nutrient-rich water emanating from the muyung. Findings also revealed the capacity of the two agroforestry systems to provide food and income for the farmers. The average total household income for the Ifugao respondents was P57,259 of which P47,935 came from their agroforestry system. For Pantabangan respondents, average total household income was P43,960 of which P6,536 came from their agroforestry system. Their agroforestry income was expected to rise further when all their fruit trees bore fruit. Adoption of agroforestry system was evaluated to be \"very good\" for the Ifugao respondents and \"fair\" for the Pantabangan respondents with average technology adoption score of 81.49% and 60.99%, respectively. In the stepwise regression analysis for Ifugao site, variables which had combined effects on agroforestry technology adoption were income from agroforestry system, knowledge of the system or technology, attraction from other adopters and soundness of agroforestry system or technology.

The socio-cultural and biophysical survey was conducted following a survey form. Relevant demographic information on natural resources in the community, especially on mangrove areas where tangal species are growing, were gathered. Results indicated Barangay Lib-og with a total population of 814 as of 1998. The area belongs to climatic type IV based on the Corona\'s Systems of Classification with a pronounced rainfall from July to December. There was no pronounced dry season from January to June. Patches of cultivation, planted to various traditional farm crops were evident. Uncultivated areas were covered mostly with grasses of cogon (Imperata cylindrica) and talahib (Saccharum spontanium), and a few patches of trees and shrubs. Occasional incidence of grass fires occur every year, especially during the dry spells. The soil is generally acidic in sloping areas and slightly acidic in the lowlands.

Seven communication network characteristics were studied, namely, general connectedness, goat raising connectedness, general integration, goat raising integration, general reciprocity, goat raising reciprocity and sociometric leadership.  The four organization involvement indicators were decision making, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. A total of 51 members of the three Goat Raisers\' Associations (GRAs) served as respondents. Two-stage simple random sampling was used in the selection of the three GRAs. Pearson Product Moments Correlation Coefficient was used to test the hypotheses of the study. The study period was from June 1989 to June 1990. Results showed that general connectedness, goat raising connectedness, sociometric leadership and monitoring were associated with the utilization of the recommended goat raising practices. General and goat raising connectedness were correlated with implementation, monitoring and evaluation while sociometric leadership was correlated with all four organization involvement variables. Low scores in general and goat raising connectedness, general and goat raising integration and general and goat raising reciprocity indicated that members of the three GRAs were loosely connected to each other. Personal networks were weakly integrated while links among members were more nonreciprocal than reciprocal. An average of two sociometric leaders in each of the seven sociometric leadership indicators was observed. The members also had low involvement in decision making, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Significant differences were found among the three GRAs in terms of general connectedness, general integration, goat raising integration, decision making, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and utilization of the recommended goat raising practices.

A randomized complete block design (RCBD) analysis of variance was used in the analysis of data gathered over 20 months of experimentation. Soil texture and particle density did not change significantly after the experiment. The soil was clay loam before the experiment and remained unchanged after the experiment. Particle density significantly increased irrespective of treatments after the experiment but did not differ significantly among the plots. Water-holding capacity of the soil increased but not statistically significant in the A. villosa and G. sepium plots. Corn monoculture plot had a significantly low water-holding capacity after the experiment. Soil pH exhibited a significant decline after the experiment irrespective of treatments. Organic matter (OM) content of the soil increased but not statistically significant in the hedgerow intercropping plots (treated) and decreased in the monoculture (control) plots. The highest OM was observed from the G. sepium plot with 6.35% for topsoil and 4.78% for subsoil after the experiment. Cation exchange capacity (CEC) did not vary significantly among the plots before and after the experiment. Monoculture plot, however, showed a sharp but not statistically significant decline in CEC after the experiment. Available phosphorous and exchangeable potassium contents of the soil were not significantly affected by alley cropping. Calcium content increased in the plots with hedgerows and decreased in the monoculture plot but differences were not significant. Likewise, exchangeable magnesium content declined significantly irrespective of plots after the experiment. Exchangeable sodium, on the other hand, increased significantly irrespective of plots after the experiment. Statistical analyses, however, revealed no significant differences among the plots in their phosphorous, potassium, calcium and sodium contents before and after the experiment. G. sepium produced the highest fresh weight of herbage with 15,166.90 kg/ha and 14,027.04 kg/ha, respectively, in 1989 and 1990. However, G. sepium had the lowest percentage dry matter of herbage with 18.83% and 22.14% respectively, for 1989 and 1990.

Water parameters, namely, salinity and pH at two different rainfall levels, were used in this study. The presence of gradient as shown by the contour map led to the choice of stratified sampling. The criteria for the determination of stratum size and shape were based on the highest relative value of the variance between strata and the variance within stratum requiring the least number of strata. Salinity at 39-cm pond water depth and 0.0-cm rainfall level showed a gradient at the vertical strips. Volume combinations of 6 x 3 x 6 were used for stratification, which divided the pond into two equal parts parallel to its length. The samples required for the first and second stratum to estimate the mean at 1% precision level were one and two, respectively. Salinity at 49-cm pond water depth and 6.68-cm rainfall level showed a distinct gradient along the horizontal strips.

Modified II starch yielded higher average percent carboxyl (0.99%) than the Modified I (0.47%). Physicochemical analyses conducted on the unmodified, modified and commercial starches revealed that hypochlorite oxidation greatly influenced the physical and chemical properties of starch. Marked decreases in the properties were observed in the modified starches. However, there was only slight effect of oxidation on granule morphology. The starches were incorporated as wet-end additives to paper handsheets. They were applied as cooked solutions at varying levels of addition based on the oven dry weight of pulp. The properties of the handsheets prepared using different levels of experimental starches were compared with handsheets made using imported commercial starches. Results showed that starch oxidized with the one-stage process (Modified I) was comparable, if not superior, to Commercial I starch in performance as wet-end additive. The above-mentioned starches were effective for printing and writing papers.  Modified II starch, on the other hand, although not comparable with the Commercial I starch, could be used as wet-end additive for wrapping and other nonspecialty papers. Furthermore, the modified starches were better than the unmodified in reducing water absorptivity of handsheets. Since the prepared additive, Modified I, had comparable effects on properties of handsheets with Commercial I, it could be a good substitute for the imported commercial additive.

Static bending tests were conducted on straight and curved beam specimens. Load was applied at the center of span and on the convex side of the curved beams. The results failed to show significant differences on the bending strength properties of the straight beams fabricated from different thicknesses of lamination. However, the properties of curved beams were significantly reduced as lamination thickness increased from 6 mm to 22 mm. Strength-lamination thickness relationships derived for each of the three radii of curvature radius were determined for each of the lamination thicknesses where radius of curvature showed significant effect on strength. Finally, the effect on strength of prestressing based on the ratio of lamination thickness (t) to radius of curvature (R) was evaluated for fiber stress at proportional limit, modules of rupture and elastic modulus. Relationships were obtained showing increasing reduction in strength as the t/R ratio increases. Curvature-stress factors as functions of the t/R ratio were derived for both extreme fiber stress in bending and modulus of elasticity for application in the structural design of elasticity for application in the structural design of curved-laminated members fabricated from tangile or species with similar response to prestressing. These factors were compared with the Wilson formula, which was currently used by structural design engineers. At the maximum t/R ratio of 1/100 currently permitted for hardwoods, the curvature-stress factor obtained in the study was 0.87 compared with 0.80 from the Wilson equation.

The first soybean crop was planted in February, the rice crop in June and the second soybean crop in November 1992. Antibiotic resistant mutants of Bradyrhizobium japonicum strain USDA 110 were used to inoculate the two soybean crops. Indigenous  bradyrhizobia population in the soil increased 100 fold from planting to harvest of the first soybean crop while the introduced inoculant, USDA 110 SpcRif, recovered from the soil was 100 times lower. Counts of bradyrhizobia in the rhizospheres were 200 times higher than in the soil for both indigenous and introduced strains. Bradyrhizobia number in the flooded soil declined during rice growth but remained higher in the rice rhizosphere.

Results showed that bradyrhizobia introduced for the first time abundantly colonized soybean roots and significantly increased nodulation, nitrogen uptake and yield of soybean. The inoculum strain survived flooding of soil and persisted up to the next soybean crop after rice but failed to dominate nodule occupancy. Inoculation of every soybean crop after rice was, therefore, necessary to ensure successful nodule occupancy. The effect of flooding and the rice plant on the survival of introduced and indigenous rhizobia was also studied in a pot experiment.

The unweighted estimated of Smith\'s index of soil heterogeneity was less accurate than weighted estimate especially when the MS replication was relatively low compared to the others. Larger plots were needed in La Granja than in Merida to cope with more heterogeneous soils.

Safe maximum daily manuring dosage was determined in micropond (plastic enclosures set in a pond) experiments with laboratory BOD1 and total solids of the manure as guide. BOD1 was measured at three temperature regimes (25, 30 and 35-37?C) and three salinity levels (15, 30 and 45 ppt), and three levels of dry matter content of manure (26, 32 and 36%). The BOD1 of manure intensified salinity up to 30 ppt (but inhibited at higher salinity), and with increasing dry matter content. The dry matter (X = 28%) and other physical characteristics of pig manure during a one-year period was relatively uniform. Calculated manuring dosage based on BOD1 did not reduce early morning oxygen saturation in microponds. Addition of higher amounts of manure (0.01-2.12 g organic matter/L) in microponds indicated that 0.01g/L reduced the next day\'s early morning oxygen saturation by 20% (1mg 02/L). Its use in calculating manure dosage for regular manuring of milkfish ponds showed varying oxygen saturation response, which seemed to be correlated with the manuring dosage in gram fresh wt/L of pond water and the number of days of application because of residual effect of previous loading. Multiple regression analysis generated an equation which was significant at the 10% level (n = 76). Regular manuring effected higher fish production (285.6 kg/ha in 70 days) than in controls (183.5 kg/ha), with milkfish survival of 97.5% and 100%, respectively. Manured ponds had higher phosphorus (P) levels (in water) and gross primary  productivity values. However, exposure to longer diurnal pulse of low oxygen saturation might have affected growth rate (0.89 g/day), aside from other environmental factors. Inherent pond characteristics influenced manuring effect. Ponds with slightly acidic water reduced P levels in water, which led to relatively lower primary productivity values.

Water was withheld, 19, 12 and 15 days after planting (DAP) for rice, corn and soybean, respectively. These were the ages of the crops when their total leaf area per plant were identical. Water stress significantly decreased leaf elongation, leaf water potential, transpiration and nutrient uptake of the crops, except potassium (K) in corn. The response of the crops to water stress differed during the dry and rainy seasons. Crops grown during the rainy season had longer period of tolerance to water stress. During the dry season, rate of leaf elongation decreased in rice earlier than the other two crops. Total nutrient content of shoots in all crops declined with the increase in soil water stress, except K in corn, possibly because of decreased transpiration and physiological impairment of the nutrient absorption and transport mechanism in the roots. K uptake in corn was not affected by water stress. In some cases, it even increased slightly. Results implied that the apparent resistance of corn and soybean to early stress might be attributed to their ability to maintain turgor brought about by low transpiration, as well as continued nutrient uptake, especially K which might allow osmotic adjustment to occur. During the rainy season, leaf elongation, leaf water potential and shoot and root dry weights declined earlier in corn than in soybean and rice. Poor growth may be caused by reduced irradiance, corn being adapted to high light intensity. With the varieties tested, the tolerance of the plant species studied to imposed water stress might be described as follows: corn > soybean > rice.

Specifically, this study: 1) described the interorganizational and intraorganizational factors that impinge on interagency communication and coordination (ICC); 2) determined the level of communication, and the extent of coordination among the member-agencies of ILARRDEC-RAC; 3) identified communication and noncommunication problems that hampered the swift implementation of the Regional Applied Communication Program; 4) identified the consequences of ICC from the point of view of the extensionist; and 5) described the interplay of level of communication, extent of coordination and consequences of ICC. All RACO Task Force members of ILARRDEC-RACO and 29 extension personnel involved in the RACO activities were administered the questionnaires specific for each group of respondents. Likewise, secondary data and key informants complemented the survey technique. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient and Kendall rank-order partial correlation coefficient. Interorganizational factors such as goals, organizational and communication structures, administrative arrangement, participation, resources and leadership contributed to interagency communication and coordination. Likewise, intraorganizational factors, namely, complexity, formalization, centralization and resources also served as inputs to the interorganizational relationship. Findings revealed that 54% of the member agencies were high in interagency communication. On the other hand, only 38% of the respondents had high degrees of interagency coordination. Problems encountered by the respondents in the operations of ILARRDEC-RACO included delayed communications, lack of time to participate in RACO activities, inadequate funds of a member-agency to finance the travels of their RACO representatives, conflicting schedules between the agency and the RACO activities and the proximal distance to the base agency. In terms of the interplay of variables studied, correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between the level of communication and extent of coordination.  This was also true for interagency communication, coordination and consequences.

Palm characters like number of functional leaves, copra weight per nut, potential and productive nuts were variable among these soil series. Annual nut yield was significantly higher in Guinobatan than in Annam, Mauraro and Tigaon series. On the other hand, Luisiana and Sevilla yielded significantly lower than any of the above series. Between series with midslope observation only, Mayon gave better yield than Legaspi. Furthermore, nut yield was higher on footslope than on midslope. Nut count varied significantly with time of harvest within a year. It was highest in September to October 1978 and lowest in January to April 1979. Moreover, nut yield was higher in July to December 1978 than in January to June 1979 for series with incomplete observations. The difference in nut yield was partly attributed to the soil properties under consideration. Individual regression analysis showed that nut yield was significantly related with pH, percent water available, phosphorus and potassium in a curvilinear trend. On the other hand, its relationship with solum was linear. Multiple regression analysis indicated that phosphorus, solum, potassium, percent clay and pH as a whole contributed 35.54% of the total variation in yield of which 17.21% and 11.84% were significantly accounted by phosphorus and solum, respectively. The productivity and potentiality of the foregoing soil series were evaluated by using the parametric method of Riquier and coresearchers in 1970. Based on soil properties, previously declared significant by individual regression analysis, the different series were grouped into two classes of productivity. Guinobatan, Mauraro, Mayon, Legaspi and Tigaon with nut yield ranging from 47.15 to 57.75 nuts per tree per annum were classified as average in productivity. Annam, Luisiana and Sevilla with palms producing from 34.70 to 46.05 nuts per tree per annum were rated as poor. Computed productivity index was linearly and positively correlated with nut yield. The use of such relationship, however, should be limited to areas with climatic conditions more or less similar to Albay. The coefficient of improvement showed that the present level of production could still be raised considerably. For instance, nut yield in Tigaon and Luisiana could be raised by as much as 2.5 and four times, respectively. In general, however, the potential productivity to coconut of all the series studied could be similar if the necessary management practices are fully employed. Liming and judicious application of N, P and Cl could increase yield considerably. Under the present level of management, the use of leguminous cover crop should be adopted to improve the supply of organic matter and help minimize soil erosion especially in the sloping areas of all series. The use of Sevilla series for coconut should be made on a selective basis. Areas with a profile less than 50 cm and with cemented calcareous materials near the ground level should not be used for coconut production.',NULL,NULL,'Lapis, Aida B.','CALAMUS (PALM), RATTANS, PLANT RESPONSE, GROWTH RATE, LIGHT REQUIREMENTS, WATER REQUIREMENTS',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2962,'2021-09-01 07:44:53','2021-09-01 07:44:53','Solar radiation interception on sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.

The study was conducted to: 1) determine the amount of light interception and transmission on sorghum; 2) determine soil water use, extinction coefficient and leaf area index of sorghum and 3) to compare the yields of sorghum at different plant densities. The experiment showed that solar radiation interception increased with plant density. Soil water use increased at higher plant densities. The highest water uptake was during the booting to dough stages (48-63 days after sowing) with mean values of 5.33 and 6.65 mm/day, respectively. The lowest (0.49 mm/day) was observed at maturity. Extinction coefficient had its peak (0.28) at 33 days after sowing and lowest (0.09) at 93 days after sowing. The highest leaf area index (LAI) was obtained from the plots with higher plant density. A maximum LAI of 5.89 was obtained 63 days after sowing and the lowest value of 2.164 was observed 33 days after sowing. The grain yield of sorghum was greatly influenced by plant density. Grain yield of sorghum increased as plant density was increased. Yield was highest (13.933 kg/plot) at a density of 383,333 plants/ha and lowest (7.040 kg/plot) at a density of 200,000 plants/ha. The regression equation, GYS = 9.8302 + 0.00127D with an R2 value of 0.998 sufficiently expressed the relationship of sorghum grain yield and plant density.

Correlation and step-wise multiple regression analyses were made and productivity indices were calculated using available data obtained from the Bureau of Soils, PHILSUGIN, PAGASA, Mill Districts and haciendas or planters. The order of importance of the parameters studied in influencing the sugar yield was observed as follows: available soil phosphorus and potassium, soil texture, soil effective depth, climate, soil organic matter content, soil internal drainage and land slope. These parameters accounted for 60.7% of the variations in sugar yield. Fertilization, therefore, was still one of the practical ways to increase cane sugar yield. The order of importance of the parameters considered in influencing the cane tonnage yield were: soil effective depth, available soil phosphorus and potassium, climate, soil texture, soil internal drainage, land slope and soil organic matter content. These parameters accounted for 68.0% of the variation in cane tonnage yield. Again, fertilization was still one of the practical ways to increase cane tonnage yield. The order of importance of the parameters in influencing cane juice quality were: soil pH, soil organic matter content, soil texture, available soil phosphorous and potassium, soil effective depth, land slope, soil internal drainage and climate. These parameters accounted for 74.4% of the variation in juice quality. Therefore, liming and fertilization were two of the practical ways to improve cane juice quality. The correlation analyses results between the yield parameters (sugar, tonnage and juice quality) and yield factors (soil properties, climate, land slope, and management) were not consistent in the sets of data analyzed. This might be caused by the effect of factors not included in the analyses. However, the results indicated the tendency of the physical and chemical properties of the soil, climate and management to influence cane sugar yield; the tendency of the physical and chemical properties of the soil influence cane tonnage yield; and the tendency of the soil pH and soil organic matter content to influence cane quality. The calculated \"soil productivity index\" was significantly correlated positively with and significantly regressed by the observed or actual sugar yield in only one of the seven sets of data studied. The lack of significance in the other sets might be caused by the effect of factors not considered in the study. Therefore, the classification of the soils in the areas of interest in terms of the calculated indices should be considered as tentative.

The model was designed to be flexible enough to consider variations in cutting cycle, which also corresponded to the growing periods, diameter growth rate as affected by the species group and intensity of stand treatment, degree of site degradation, diameter cutting limit, utilization efficiency, extent and intensity of timber stand improvement activities, and the area for timber production. The computer program was written in Fortran IV consisted of a main program and seven subroutines. It was test-run in the IBM 370 computer of the Agricultural Resoruces Center at College, Laguna using data gathered from a wood industrial firm in Northeastern Mindanao. Results of the simulation runs indicated that selective logging as practiced in the company would not give sustained yield of timber. Other variants of selective logging that were examined also showed the nonsustainability of timber yield. Most of the strategies investigated gave acceptable yield only up to the second cutting cycle. The few ones that reached the third cutting cycle had the common element of including timber stand improvement in the treatment combinations. Some operational weaknesses of selective logging in the company were pointed out and discussed. These were the use of unrealistic area for timber production in the computation of the allowable cut, the half-hearted implementation of selective logging, the obvious failure of tree marking and residual inventory to come up with acceptable residual stocking levels, the poor implementation of the forest protection program. Likewise, the apparent lack of sustained appreciation of commitment and sincerity on the part of the company and the government\'s regulatory agency to give selective logging the chance to succeed under the concept of sustained yield forest management were taken up. Recommendations for improving the timber production system for the dipterocarp forest and alternate systems were presented. Some ecological analysis were done on the timber resources of the company to serve as references in the development of the simulation model and the generation of alternative management strategies. It was found out that the most important species were mayapis (Shorea squamata) for common hardwoods, ulayan (Lithorarpus llanosii) for furniture and construction hardwoods, gubas (Endospermum peltatum) for softwoods and piling liitan (Canarium luzonicum) for other species. Species similarity was marked between areas having the same or nearly the same elevations than between areas differing substantially in elevation.

The performance of the harvester was determined based on the following criteria: power requirement, percentage of tubers exposed after one pass and percentage of tubers bruised after one pass. The above variables were affected by numerous factors such as design of the share and the harvester in general, soil and crop factors, ridge cross-section and operator and animal skills. The harvester was all made of steel and was composed of the following main parts: beam or main frame, share or blade welded with slide rods, landslide and steering handle. The share was replaceable and had three sizes, namely, 100-mm, 80-mm and 60-mm widths. Each harvester with a particular share size and a local moldboard plow were tested in two types of soil (Clay loam and clayey silt) planted to two varieties of sweet potato (BNAS 51 and Sinampedro). The general performance results per harvester showed that in terms of power requirement, the local moldboard plow had the lowest (0.692 hp) followed by the 100-mm share (0.865 hp), the 80-mm share (0.971 hp) and the 60-mm share (1.035 hp). In terms of percent exposure of tubers, the local moldboard plow had the highest (72.80), followed by the 100-mm share (68.54), the 60-mm share (67.55) and 80-mm share (62.23). In terms of percent damaged tubers, the 60-mm share had the lowest (1.81), followed by the 80-mm share (2.08), the local moldboard plow (2.73) and the 100-mm share (3.11). Although the moldboard plow appeared as better than the designed harvesters in terms of power requirement and tuber exposure, it had a high percentage of bruised tubers. On the other hand, the 60-mm harvester with the least bruising required the highest horsepower while the 80-mm harvester had the lowest tuber exposure. The 100-mm harvester was the second best. Although the moldboard plow performed best for this study, moldboard plow from other localities might not perform well under the conditions in this study. The plow used in the tests might not work well also if used under different conditions. Hence, further improvements in the design of the harvesters should be made to come up with a design that could be standardized and be more efficient than the moldboard plow and thus, acceptable to sweet potato farmers.',NULL,NULL,'Sibal, Pedro V.','FOREST PRODUCTS, FOREST PRODUCTS, ECONOMETRICS, ECONOMETRICS, SUPPLY BALANCE, SUPPLY BALANCE, PHILIPPINES, PHILIPPINES, Industry, Industry',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2967,'2021-09-01 07:44:53','2021-09-01 07:44:53','The Filipino worker in a transforming society: social psychological perspectives.','1979-09-01','This dissertation examined the nature of personality and work values among newly industrializing workers.

Four levels of the disease were successfully generated by varying the frequency of Benlate application at 30, 45 and 60 days after planting (DAP). Results showed that tar spot significantly reduced yield of UPL Sg-5. Significant yield losses of 37.47, 25.36 and 13.30% resulted in 95.36, 74.25 and 35.01% leaf area infected, respectively.

Three isolates of B. bassiana were evaluated for pathogenicity against L. oratocius. GLH isolate was the most potent with LC50 of 4.65 x 10 9th; 2.22 x 10 9th; 3.68 x 10 9th and 1.3 x 10 9th conidia/ml for third instar, fourth instar, fifth instar and adults, respectively.

Subsequent transfer of fruits to 25?C after six or nine days storage at 0?C did not aggravate the extent of surface pitting but this intensified the browning of seeds and pulp. On the other hand, the effect of chilling temperature was still reversible when fruits were kept for only three days at 0?C before transfer to 25?C. CI in fruits was associated with high and rapid moisture loss resulting in deformation and collapse of subsurface cells, which consequently resulted in surface pitting of fruits. It was also characterized by low rate of respiration and ethylene production. However, the rate of increase was more rapid at 0?C than at 5 and 10?C. Increase in respiration rate was associated with the development of CI. Polyphenoloxidase (PPO) activity and total phenols increased before and at occurrence of the injury symptoms. The increase in both activity and levels of PPO accounted for the browning at chilling temperature. CI symptoms appeared one day earlier and the injury was more severe in immature than in mature fruits.  Consequently, storability was two to three days shorter in the immature fruits.  Mature fruits stored at 0?C can be kept in good condition for only 12-15 days because of CI. Storability was extended to as long as 26-28 days without CI at 10-15?C and 23-25 days at 5?C because of slight CI.

All the respondents in high- and low-income municipalities had agreed on the most desirable characteristics that should be primarily possessed by an extension worker. He or she should be trustworthy, understanding, skilled and proficient in modern farming applications, industrious, intelligent, innovative and a good adviser and teacher. This finding somehow conformed with competence, trustworthiness, and dynamism factors found in the US study of Berlo, Lemert and Mertz. Similarly, it corroborated the sociability dimension Ca?edo\'s study among Maranao rice farmers in the Philippine setting. In terms of the agreement between ranks assigned to the credidibility characteristics, a close association was found between rankings of credibility characteristics given by respondents in the categories under the demographic and socioeconomic groupings. This was an indication that the respondents irrespective of their classifications in the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics groups did not differ in their perceptions of characteristics important for high credibility. Similarly, an agreement was found between the ranks of the credibility characteristics assigned by rice farmers in high-class barangays and those assigned by rice farmers in low-class barangays in both high- and low-income municipalities.

The study was conducted in two barangays, namely, San Casimiro, Licab, Nueva Ecija and Gatiawin, Arayat, Pampanga. A total of 77 respondents were interviewed using an interview schedule. Knowledge retention was measured using a pretest-posttest materials prepared by the RACO of CLARRDEC. Results showed that the respondents were predominantly male and they were middle-aged. They had low education attainment and relatively short farming experiences. They had low income and majority were members of one or more organizations. Almost all of the respondents made use of print media (newspaper and brochure) and listened to farm news programs, news, musical and drama every morning. The respondents mentioned cofarmers, barangay captains and technicians as interpersonal sources of information. The respondents from San Casimiro rated the different attributes of the program as satisfactory to outstanding while those from Gatiawin gave a rating of fair to satisfactory. Most of the respondents from Gatiawin preferred female announcer while those from San Casimiro chose a male one. Results of the retention of information and knowledge-application were both highly significant. Retention of information was significantly related to some of the independent variables like frequency of reading newspaper and brochure, frequency of listening to musical, drama and home programs, frequency of talking to all interpersonal sources mentioned and respondents\' perception towards all of the SOA attributes. Correlation analysis revealed that knowledge-application was significantly related to some of the independent variables like educational attainment, use/frequency of reading print media, frequency of talking to technician and cofarmers, and some of the SOA attributes such as timeliness, frequency and clearness of broadcast.

Control plants produced significantly higher yield per plot, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod and average number of seeds per plant than the stressed plants. Plants stressed twice, once at flowering and again at yield formation stage, resulted in a 53.50% reduction in yield while plants subjected to stress period at vegetative state resulted in a 2.06% reduction in yield only. Based on the sensitivity index values, the most critical stage was the yield formation stage followed by flowering and vegetative stages. Regression analysis on the relationship of water stress period (Xi) to soybean yield (Y) revealed a highly significant linear decrease in yield as stress condition, regardless of the number of wilting days, was imposed at an early growth stage to later part of its growth period. The equation was Y = 2.60 - 0.28 Xi. It revealed an 86.66% of the variation of yield data among the treatment groups. The overall results of the study showed that CLSOY 1 variety was sensitive to moisture deficit condition especially during the later stage of the crop development. In case of limited water supply, irrigation requirement could be minimized by applying irrigation water only after eight days of wilting since soybean plants could tolerate two to eight days of wilting at vegetative, flowering and yield formation stages without significant effect on yield. These results, however, might only be applicable provided the area had sandy loam soil and the water table depth from the ground surface ranged from 75 to 110 cm during the entire growing period of the crop. The recommended irrigation guidelines for maximizing yield under water deficit condition were as follows: a) for moderate water  supply - soybean might be subjected to water deficit condition at vegetative stage to the extent of reaching temporary wilting stage for eight days, after which apply irrigation whenever the available soil moisture dropped to 50-60%; and b) for limited water supply - soybean might be subjected to water deficit condition once at vegetative and again at yield formation stage or once at vegetative stage and again at flowering stage, after which apply irrigation water whenever the available soil moisture dropped to 50-60%.',NULL,NULL,'Talam, George L.','SUGARCANE, PLANT SOIL RELATIONS, ACID SOILS, SANDY CLAY LOAM, LIMING',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(2979,'2021-09-01 07:44:53','2021-09-01 07:44:53','Changes in the rumen composition in goats fed ipil-ipil and farm by products.','1993-09-01','Sixteen intact female goats were used in a completely randomized design (CRD) to determine the digestibility of rice straw, ipil-ipil, sugarcane bagasse and dried sugarcane tops.

Punta, Calamba, Laguna but not in eggmasses collected from La Trinidad, Benguet.All isolates of P. lilacinus were capable of parasitizing M. incognita eggs, larvae and adults and reducing the egg hatching of root-knot nematode. A preliminary test on the use of P. lilacinus isolates on the control of M. incognita on tomato in the greenhouse showed that the Philippine and Peruvian isolates gave 72-85% and 90.58-91% control, respectively. Oatmeal agar was the best medium for sporulation and growth of P. lilacinus. The optimum temperature for all the isolates was 20-30?C; however, the best sporulation occurred at 30?C. In general, continuous darkness favored sporulation of P. lilacinus. The fungus also grew abundantly in sterilized mashed potato, chopped water lily plants, fresh and dried ipil-ipil leaves and corn grits; and moderately well on rice hull and coir dust. Laboratory test showed that Nemacur 10G and Furadan 3G had no significant effect on the growth and sporulation of the fungal isolates except isolate 4.

Sixty-seven percent of the expenses were on food for daily consumption followed by fiesta expenses, purchase of clothing, purchase of medicine and doctors\' consultation fees, etc. The least expenditures, those with less than one percent allocation, were the children\'s primary and intermediate education,  contribution to the barangay activities/projects, movies and benefit shows, cash donations and purchase of weeders and bolos. The study revealed that age, economic assets, size of the family, stage of family life cycle, occupation and size of money income were related to the decision-making patterns as to the buying of food for daily consumption, saving money in the house, having a fiesta, buying medicine and consulting a doctor and buying of bolos.

The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics such as ratio and proportions, frequency counts and averages. All cooperating farmers and almost all noncooperating farmers were male, married and in their early 30s and 40s, respectively. Their average number of children was three and four while their mean number of years of residence in their barangay was 21 years and 27 years, respectively. All of them had attended formal education/schooling, were Cebuano speaking and were members and/or officers in three farmer associations in their barangay. Their chief source of income was coffee farming, giving them an average annual income of P21,700.00 and P26,771.00, respectively. Their average annual income from other income-generating activities like business, rice farming and fishing reached P29,300.00 and P19,514.00, respectively. Meanwhile, their farm size ranged from 1 to 11 ha and above with an average of 7 and 4 ha, respectively. Aware of other coffee technologies before 1988 through Nestle and Department of Agriculture (DA), they also indicated their awareness of coffee technologies through the wallnews, leaflet, primer 1 and primer 2. As regards their degree of  knowledge, cooperating farmers showed a very high knowledge on coffee diseases but only moderate knowledge on coffee propagation. On the other hand, the degree of knowledge of noncooperating farmers on the four technologies ranged from moderate to very high. Their perception of the four print materials ranged from \"agree\" to \"strongly agree\" while their attitude towards the technologies found in these print materials was within the \"mildly favorable\" to \"very favorable\" range.All of them had partially adopted in their farm at least three of the four coffee technologies found in the print materials, and that they were full adoptors of the same, having followed all recommended steps/practices. However, majority of them were still applying these technologies on a small scale. Their reasons were \"easy management,\" \"affordability\" and \"success.\" Those who tried but later stopped, though few, reasoned that they \"lost interest,\" \"lacked assistance\" and \"were wary about the technologies\' potential.\" All four print materials were effective in terms of color, illustration/s size, content and design, and  technology dissemination. They also found the said materials very easy to read.

Snyder and Hansen as measured by the incidence of damping-off disease of Benguet pine. Residue leachates were likewise incorporated into a potato dextrose agar medium to determine their effects on the radial growth of the test fungi mycelia. In the greenhouse study, rono and cogon residues initially inhibited the virulence of R. solani. However, after 455 days, no inhibitory effect was observed. Plant residues stimulated the virulence of C. scoparium, C. tuberculata, and F. oxysporum as manifested by increased mortality rates of Benguet pine seeds and seedlings. Wild sunflower stimulated most the virulence of the test fungi by 52%. Cogon, rono and pine residues stimulated the virulence of the test fungi by 27, 18 and 12%, respectively. Plant residues likewise increased pH, organic matter content, organic carbon and organic nitrogen of the soil while at the same time decreasing the C:N ratio below 20, which could have contributed to the increased incidence of damping-off disease of Benguet pine. Radial growth of R. solani mycelia was reduced by pine leachates by 27%. Rono, cogon and wild sunflower likewise reduced the radial growth of R. solani by eight percent. Incorporating a ten percent concentration of each leachate reduced the radial growth of R. solani by nine percent. Plant leachate had no significant effect on the radial growth of C. tuberculata and C. scoparium but hastened growth of F. oxysporum.

With regard to the Supervisory Factors such as communication about the FORCOED, supervision, leadership advocacy, endorsement and support of the FORCOED had very significant relationship with performance of teachers in the adoption/rejection of the curricular innovation on FORCOED. The Administrative Factors such as in-service education and support materials had also very significant relationship with teachers\' performance. All the above factors greatly influenced the adoption of the program. As in agricultural innovation, adoption/rejection in the educational process passed through different stages.

Other important characters studied were plant height, stalk diameter, total dry matter yield, fiber length, percent dry fiber recovery, green and brown capsule count and seed yield. Fiber qualities studied were color, fineness and tensile strength. In both kenaf and jute, higher levels of N significantly increased plant height, stalk diameter, total dry matter yield, fiber length, percent dry fiber recovery, capsule count, seed and fiber yields. Fiber color was brighter but coarser from plants treated with higher rates of N fertilizer. For kenaf, tensile strength was significantly stronger with plants fertilized with 100 kg N/ha than the unfertilized ones, while jute fiber strength did not vary with N rates. The results indicated that 100 kg N/ha was, probably, optimum for better dry fiber yield and fiber quality for kenaf and jute. The time of harvest significantly influenced fiber yield. Plants harvested at full bloom and early pod stages in jute, and at early pod and peak pod stages in kenaf yielded the highest fiber. The added advantage of harvesting kenaf and jute during the early pod stage was the production of seeds for planting purposes. Time of harvest significantly influenced fiber quality. Fibers from plants harvested at 50% blooming up to early pod stages had bright color, fine and strong fibers while later harvests (peak pod and dry pod stages) had dull, coarse and weak fibers.

The changes in the  population of ammonifiers, nitrifiers, and cellulose decomposers were also studied. Ammonification proceeded at a faster rate in soils under intact mangrove vegetation than in soils under the denuded counterparts. The magnitude of NH4 -N production followed the order: Avicennia > Rhizophora > Nypa. The removal of Avicennia alba from three to four years and Rhizophora apiculata from two to three years had resulted in the lowering of the soil organic matter. This explained the decrease in  NH4 -N release. NH4 -N production in the Nypa area was characteristically low with the organic matter content, the lowest among the vegetation types studied. The level of NO3 -N production was significantly higher in the denuded areas than in the vegetated counterparts. The magnitude of NO3 -N produced was of the general order: Avicennia > Rhizophora > Nypa. The results pointed to the more favorable oxidative conditions in denuded areas and more reducing conditions in areas under mangrove vegetation. Organic matter decomposition as measured by CO2 evolution was significantly higher in the soils from the disturbed area. This observation resulted from the favorable redox conditions prevailing in denuded areas.

Delayed unfolding of the younger leaf, interveinal chlorosis of the older leaves and production of blank stalk and barren ears were noted in corn plants without boron treatment. Application of boron increased the dry matter accumulation and grain yield. Optimum concentration of boron for maximum yield was 30 ppm. Boron facilitated the transport of carbohydrates from the leaves to the other parts of the plant especially to the grains. It did not affect the protein distribution within the plant. The highest concentration of boron was found in the leaves indicating the necessity of the micronutrient at the site of sugar synthesis. Application of boron in the germination medium enhanced the alpha amylase activity of corn seedlings. The 72-hour boron-treated seedlings exhibited higher enzyme activity than the 24-hour and continuously-boron treated seedlings. Maximum activity was noted during the third and seventh day of germination regardless of the level of boron used. The decrease in dry matter accumulation was correlated with the increase in the enzyme activity.

Arroyo and her coresearchers in 1977, was fermented at tropical room temperature by a sequence but overlapping growth of lactic acid bacteria. Fermentation was initiated by Streptococcus sp., followed by Leuconostoc sp., which was soon outnumbered by Pediococcus sp. The ten-day fermentation was completed by the high acid-producing homofermentative Lactobacillus sp. The activity of these lactics caused an increase in the titrable acidity of the product with a concomitant decrease in pH. During the ten-day fermentation, however, differences in the microbial flora and pH-titrable acidity values among the three batches of balao-balao prepared at different occasions were noted. Volatile acidity of the ten-day old samples also differed. These could be caused by the differences in fermentation temperature and salt concentration. In all three batches, however, the fermentation was practically homofermentative because of the predominance of Pediococci and Lactobacilli. Inoculation of newly prepared balao-balao with the high acid homofermenter Lactobacillus sp. obtained from a previous fermentation increased fermentation rate without causing a deleterious effect on sensory qualities. Inoculation with other lactics isolated from fermenting balao-balao did not give a substantial improvement over the control.

The objectives of the study were (1) to determine the effects of cultivation with rice-rice cropping on Quingua clay loam and Carig loam, rice-fallow cropping on Toran silty clay and Alaminos clay loam, traditional rice-fallow cropping on Toran silty clay in Aparri, Cagayan; (2) to determine the effects of corn-tobacco, corn-peanut, corn-fallow and rice-rice cropping on San Manuel silt loam; (3) to determine the effects of rice-mungbean, rice-fallow and corn-fallow cropping on Carig clay loam. Cultivation decreased the soil organic matter, capillary porosity, exchangeable Ca and pH. Cultivation decreased organic matter content of Quingua clay loam cropped with HYV rice-rice and toran silty clay cropped with HYV rice-fallow and Toran silty clay cropped with traditional rice-fallow but increased in Carig loam cropped with HYV rice-rice and Alaminos clay loam cropped with HYV rice-fallow. The increase in organic matter content of the said soils was attributed to rice residue incorporation and slow decomposition during submergence. Cultivation of Quingua clay loam and Carig loam with rice-rice cropping enhanced acidification and decreased exchangeable Ca. Cultivation of Toran silty and Alaminos clay loam with rice-fallow cropping decreased exchangeable K. Rice-based cropping systems such as rice-rice, rice-fallow and rice-mungbean had greater soil organic matter than corn-based cropping systems such as corn-peanut, corn-fallow and corn-tobacco. The higher organic matter content of the rice-based cropping systems was attributed to the incorporation of rice residue during land preparation and slow decomposition  during submergence. For maintaining soil organic matter, the HYV rice-rice cropping with fertilization and the corn-tobacco cropping were best in their respective group.  Rice-mungbean cropping decreased soil organic matter and compacted the soil.  Corn-fallow cropping slightly increased organic matter but enhanced leaching of exchangeable bases during fallow period.

Bush sitao pot test was conducted at UPLB as a folllow up of the field succession test. In the intercropping and succession experiments (Expt. I & II) tomato and cabbage yielded more than the other crops, which indicated that they were heavy tonner while green onion and bush bean were light tonner. The peso values of cabbage and tomato were significant at 0.01 level of probability compared to either bush bean or green onion.  In terms of return per peso investment, cabbage had the highest followed by tomato while bush bean and green onion reached only the break-even point. In the intercropping experiment at UPLB, tomato and green onion produced more during the dry season than the rainy season. Cabbage produced more during the rainy season than the dry season. At MSAC, cabbage, tomato and bush bean produced more during the dry season than the rainy season while the green onion had the same yield in both seasons. In the cropping systems, tomato had more yield significantly at 0.01 level of probability in the three-crop system than the one-crop system at UPLB in both seasons. Cabbage yielded significantly more in the one-crop system than the three-crop system at UPLB in both seasons. In MSAC similar trend was observed on tomato during the rainy season but not on cabbage in both seasons. In the crop combinations, the presence of tomato consistently lowered the yield of cabbage because of smaller and lighter heads at UPLB in the rainy season.  While the other crops did not have significant allelopathic effect with other under the conditions of the experiment, there seemed to be slight incompatibility between bush beans and green onions as intercrops. There was no significant incidence of insect pests and diseases that was attributable to either the cropping systems or crop combinations. In the succession experiment, cabbage, tomato and green onion did not show any self-allelopathy or allelopathic effect with each other in both locations.  Under UPLB conditions, bush sitao had a highly significant self-allelopathy. The yield of bush sitao from plots previously planted to bush sitao was statistically lower at 0.01 level of significance compared to the yield of plots previously planted to green onion and cabbage. Likewise, the plots previously planted to tomato had lower yield of bush sitao compared to the plots previously planted to green onion, which was significant at 0.05 level of probability. The yield of bush bean from plots previously planted to the same crop at MSAC was significantly lower compared to those previously planted to tomato indicating self-allelopathy in bush bean. The greenhouse experiments (III) in both locations during the rainy season did not show any significant differences among the treatments maybe because of poor light penetration and high temperature in the glasshouse. In Expt. IV, bush sitao affected significantly the rate of germination of All Season cowpea. However, this effect did not show up in the yield of the crop. The residue pot test (Expt. V) showed that the treatments with the most bush sitao residue produced highly significantly lower pod yield of bush sitao compared to the control. This confirmed the result of the field expeirment that the first crop of bush sitao reduced highly significantly the yield of the succeeding crop of bush sitao.

The level of available zinc in alluvial soils varied with the parent material. Soils derived from marine and terrestial sediments contained available zinc greater than the critical value of 1.00 ppm whereas soils derived from marine clastics contained lower than 1.00 ppm available zinc. The distribution of available zinc as affected by pH, organic matter, available phosphorus clay, and clay plus silt was discussed. The pH value and amount of silt plus clay exhibited a positive relationship with available zinc while available P exhibited an inverse relationship with available zinc. Relationship was found between organic matter and available zinc.  Available zinc exhibited an inverse quadratic relationship with amount of clay. Organic matter, pH, available phosphorus, amount of clay and clay plus silt had no influence on the profile distribution of available zinc between the first-foot and the second-foot layers.

It investigated the physical inputs necessary to increase farmers\' yield levels and the reasons why farmers were not using these inputs. A total of 189 corn farmers and key informants were interviewed in nine selected corn growing barrios.The analysis of the package of technology (POT) trials in the area revealed that the adoption of recommended fertilizer, variety, weed control methods and planting methods gave significantly higher yields than the farmers\' practice. An added yield of 1.8 t/ha was realized when these inputs were used simultaneously. The economic advantage of the POT over the farmers\' practice amounted to P1,260.00/ha, with fertilizer use showing the largest profit differential. On the farm level, the use of these inputs by farmers gave lower yields and economic profitability than the POT.  However, yield differences between farms using high, low and no inputs were not significant except in Siaton. The economic advantages were neither distinct and in most cases, the adoption of yield increasing inputs added more to cost than to total returns. It could, therefore, be inferred that the available corn technology did not perform well under the conditions faced by the farmers in the area. Chi-square tests showed that the significant explanatory variables associated with varietal use were education, farm size, technical knowledge and extension. Likewise, these factors plus a number of socioeconomic variables, such as tenure, variety, yield per hectare and credit availability were significantly associated with the use of purchased input. The multiple regression analysis manifested a significant effect of technical knowledge and tenure on the amount spent on purchased inputs for all croppings. Distance from input sources was inversely related to input use and showed significant coefficients in the first cropping and in the pooled two cropping seasons. The effect of credit availability on input expenditures was significant in Siaton and on pooled data in Dauin. Extension and variety were directly related to input expenditures on pooled data in Dauin and in all areas, respectively. As reported by the farmers, the major factors keeping corn yields low were adverse climatic factors, insects and pests, lack of fertilizer, diseases, weeds, rats and stray animals, in that order. Nonadoption of recommended practices was mainly caused by economic factors, lack of knowledge, unavailability of inputs and physical factors such as soil problems and climatic conditions.

It also determined the communication systems and structures existing in the communities studied and establish its role in the evolution, preservation, maintenance and use of indigenous knowledge systems and practices. The study was mainly quantitative. It used the ethnographic techniques of participant observation, informal interviews and group discussion to gather data on the existing indigenous agroforest knowledge, practices and communication behavior of the Bugkalots. On the other hand, the survey method was employed to determine the socio-demographic and economic profile of the respondents and the existing communication structure in the community. The Bugkalots in the study had an average age of 39 years. Most of them reached elementary school and, hence, functionally literate in terms of ability to read and write, communicate and make basic computations. Majority of the respondents were new members of formal organizations formed in their barangay as an offshoot of the Casecnan Multipurpose Irrigation and Power Project (CMIPP) implementation. Likewise, they were affiliated mostly with church-based informal organizations. The study also showed that Bugkalots were generally subsistence farmers who depended on agroforest resources for livelihood. Their estimated annual income of P6,720.00 from a hectare-swidden farm was way below the poverty level and revealed their impoverishment. The Bugkalot agroforest farming knowledge and practices were conceivably sustainable in maintaining biodiversity and sustenance to people. Their cropping pattern mimicked the forest in diversification because of the different varieties of rice, rootcrops and legumes planted. It also showcased intercropping wherein a combination or mixture of crops is planted and harvested at different times in a single site. In addition, the cultural management practices of the Bugkalots exhibited sustainability in terms of cultivation, fertilization and pests and diseases control. The traditional beliefs, practices and other cultural practices that accompany the Bugkalots\' farming activites helped establish a strong social relationship among community members. Findings also showed that the Bugkalots have a rich form of indigenous communication system. They have a unique way of expressing themselves, conveying information and concerting their efforts to affirm their cause. Kins, friends and neighbors were the Bugkalots\' source of information. Thus, the links maybe described as kin-oriented. The barangay leaders who were also their relatives, friends and neighbors served as \"linkers\" to individuals and institutions outside their community. Most of the interactions were interpersonal and either in a dyad or a clique. These \"linkers\" as purveyors or a change could be tapped by government and other agencies concerned during program planning to come up with socially, economically and culturally acceptable development projects. Information flows in the community from the indigenous formal links, which emerged from the roles they performed, and the indigenous informal networks formed through the \"bataresan\" system in agroforest farming. The mainstreaming of one barangay into a lowlanders\' milieu had an effect on the Bugkalots\' cohesiveness. The presence of other tribal groups and lowlanders had separated the once contiguous residences and might have weaken group cohesiveness. The precence of a dyad and an isolate in the community network could be attributed to this. The Bugkalots taught their young by word-of-mouth, hands-on-experiences and coaching. They also made toys, which were miniature copies of the things used in farming and in the household for their children. Through this methods of educating the younger generation, the indigenous (or nonindigenous) agroforest farm practices and the societal and cultural norms of the Bugkalots have survived. The study have implications on sustainable development and communication and extension programs. Indigenous knowledge is a rich resource of information where socio-cultural, economic and technological concerns would benefit.

The study aimed to 1) compare the growth performance of yemane and mahogany trees based on total height and stump diameter, 2) identify the site conditions favorable for the growth of trees in forest plantations, 3) classify forestation sites according to their suitability for planting yemane and mahogany and 4) develop mathematical models for predicting species performance. The study area was subdivided into three zones, namely, a) Zone 1, b) Zone 2 and 3) Zone 3. Purposive sampling was used in data collection and sample plots were established randomly. Primary and secondary data were gathered for the study. Results showed that yemane and mahogany trees in Mindanao were bigger and taller compared with those trees in Visayas and Luzon areas. Classification of sites of yemane and mahogany was done using equations derived from the discriminant analysis. This could be classified into Site Class 1, Site Class 2, Site Class 3, Site Class 4 and Site Class 5. Site variables like age of plantation, planting density, slope, potassium content in the soil at A-horizon and wind speed significantly affected stump diameter of yemane. This meant that stump diameter growth increased with an increasing age of plantation. On the other hand, with closed spacing among tress, there was slow growth in stump diameter. Likewise, stump diameter became smaller as the slope increased and as the wind speed strengthened. Total height of yemane trees responded positively with increasing age, higher soil pH at A-horizon and increasing slope, but negatively responded to higher elevation, sufficient potassium content in the soil at A-horizon, alkaline soil and higher phosphorus content particularly at B-horizon, higher rainfall and temperature. In the regression analysis, the stump diameter growth among mahogany trees had positively responded with age of plantation, slope and relative humidity, but negatively affected by increasing planting density, elevation and wind speed.

Hierachical cluster analysis for morphological traits showed eight clusters at 9.40 euclidean distance. Euclidean distance as a dissimilarity measure for morphological traits ranged from 2.05 to 17.06. Low dissimilarity values and clustering was observed even among trees obtained across sites. Hence, there was a weaker link between geographic origin and clustering of trees. Principal component analysis of the data matrix further showed that the original variables could be reduced to 12 components that accounted for 72.50% of the total variability suggesting the multidimensional nature of the morphological characters and the weak correlation among characters being examined. High linear association among morphological characters were observed only between traits: fruit weight and total fruitlet weight (r = 0.8171), and fruit weight and weight unedible portion (r = 0.8373).

A total of 304 agrarian reform beneficiaries (ARB) were interviewed. Statistical Procedures for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyze data. Average productivity for three crop years (1994-97) was generally low at 44.47 t/ha that is about 31%, 29% and 22% lower than the mill district, regional and national average yields of 63.96, 62.24 and 57.08 TC/ha, respectively. Low productivity were influenced by extending ratooning more than two times, absence of irrigation and narrow row spacing. Low application of fertilizers, particularly nitrogen also explained low yields. One ARC, however, the Sta. Cruz ARC produced an average yield of 80 t/ha under a collective farming scheme. ARC soil had low pH (<6.5) and nutrient levels except potassium. Topsoil depth averaged 31.20 cm and majority of the ARB farms were located in flat to gently rolling areas. Per Soil Quality Index (SQI) analysis, only eight ARCs were moderately suitable for sugrcane growing while six ARCs were less suitable for sugarcane production. Four ARCs were unclassified as topsoil depths were not obtained. Only few ARBs were adopting ecologically sound practices like trash mulching, intercropping, biological control of sugarcane borer, organic fertilization, contour farming and composting. Production costs ranged from P11,300.00 to P33,480.00 in the plant crop and P8,157.00-P16,891.00 in the ratoons.

Four nursery experiments were done -- 1) seedling production from seeds, 2) seedling production from cuttings, 3) effects of hormones, levels of concentration and positions of stem and 4) effects of Mykovam 1, COM-T and NPK. Some physiological characteristics of dagwey were observed including extraction and identification of mycorrhiza on its roots. The study found out that unmacerated plus broadcast-sown seeds had the highest percentage of germination (68.3%) but that macerated plus drill-sown seeds had the highest survival (99.6%). In the seeds longevity test, the one-month-old dagwey seeds, without any seed treatment, showed the highest percentage of germination (71.0%). All seeds soaked in hot water for ten minutes up to one hour did not germinate. The four different lengths of dagwey cuttings did not significantly affect sprouting. All of those cuttings that sprouted (49.33%) died four to eight weeks after sprouting. Growth hormones, such as IBA, Rootone F and ANAA, at four levels were applied to three positions of the stem (basal, middle and shoot parts). IBA and Rootone F improved the sprouting of cuttings with both 95.83%, but the levels of concentration did not significantly affect such sprouting. IBA also enhanced the nodal sprouting (nodes 4 and 5) of cuttings. Rooting was not improved by the hormones applied. However, the 100 ppm level of concentration had significant effect on the length of roots of cuttings. On the performance of dagwey cuttings from different parts of the donor tree, all (100%) of the shoot-part cuttings sprouted, rooted and survived.

A set of two-dimensional media for specific science lessons were developed. The media was used by two groups of samples in their respective classes. Before the experiment, a pretest was conducted to ensure homogeneity of samples. After integrating the methods in their lessons for two quarters, formative and posttest results showed marked differences in scores between the pretest and posttest of the two groups. These findings further placed value on the role of media in improving cognitive learning. The use of media without equal presentation skills resulted in minimal increase in cognitive development. Future instructional media training courses should first consider a teacher-centered orientation in planning for instructional media, instead of dealing solely with media resource generation.

Twenty erosion plots (1.2 x 11.0 m; 29% slope) were set up at the MSAC-PTRI experimental area in La Trinidad, Benguet. The amount of runoff, soil loss and percent vegetative cover were recorded for each runoff-producing rainfall from July to October 1980. The cover crops used were winged bean, stylo, centrosema, star grass, para grass, star grass + stylo mixture and sweet potato. There were ten treatments including the control (bare, no vegetative cover). There were no significant differences in runoff and soil loss at the early growth stages of the crop. After two months, the grasses, grass-legume mixtures and sweet potato started to permit  lesser runoff and soil loss compared to legumes and the bare plot. Percent vegetative cover showed that there was an inverse relationship with soil loss. The  decreasing order of effectiveness of the different cover crops in preventing runoff and soil loss was sweet potato > para grass + stylo mixture > star grass + winged bean mixture > kikuyu > para grass > star grass > centrosema > stylo > winged bean.

Twelve entries for each trial were evaluated at the University of the Philippines Los Ba?os (UPLB), College, Laguna and Northern Mindanao Integrated Agricultural Research Center (NOMIARC), Dalwangan, Malaybalay, Bukidnon for yield and horticultural characteristics using Randomized Complete Block Design. Fruit qualities were evaluated at NOMIARC and fruit shelf life was evaluated at the growing areas and at Central Mindanao University (CMU) after transport. Entries were laid out in a Complete Block design.  Results showed highly significant differences on yield, horticultural characteristics and shelf life among entries. Nor hybrids had the highest yield with good horticultural traits among entries at UPLB trial. Marikit X Nor2  outyielded significantly all the entries with a marketable yield of 30 t/ha, was the earliest to flower, (24 DAT) and to mature (64.7 DAT) and had bigger fruit size (60 g)/fruit.  Maigaya X Nor2 got the highest marketable yield (60 t/ha) at NOMIARC trial but flowered and matured later than the normal varieties. Cultivar Fireball (rin) had high adaptability to NOMIARC condition than the other homozygous ripening mutants with insignificantly yield difference between Marikit. Ripening of stored fruits was slower in all hybrids and homozygous cultivar Fireball (rin) than the normal varieties, Marikit and Improved Pope, but only a week delayed and with lighter red color. Homozygous LA3 (rin), AL2 (alc) and Nor2 ripened slowly than the hybids and remained predominantly yellow in storage but intensified differently at physiological maturity. Relatively, their fruits remained very firm in all storage conditions and maturity stages than the hybrids and normal varieties. Highest TSS content across stages of maturity and in stored fruits was observed in LA3 (rin). Maigaya X La2 (alc) exhibited the longest shelf life of 25 and 17.3 weeks, respectively, in mature green and breaker fruits stored under ambient cool temperature at UPLB i.e., when all of the  fruits were no longer marketable. On the other hand, all the nor hybrids had shortest shelf life significantly similar with  Marikit. At NOMIARC, homozygous LA2 (alc)  significantly exhibited the longest average shelf life of 23.3 weeks in mature green and 26.0 weeks in breaker stage among entries i.e., when 50% of the fruits were no longer marketable. Remaining fruits were kept seven months longer after harvest with good visual quality. After transport, LA2 (alc) consistently had the longest shelf life among entries but only when harvested at mature green stage with a mean of 22.8 weeks.

In addition, the influence of E. globulus leaf litter on C and N mineralization in soils from pasture and native forest was examined and the Carbon, Energy, Nutrients and Water (CenW) model was used to assess the effect of fertilizer and E. globulus leaf litter addition on soil N mineralization. Application of N-and-P fertilizer significantly increased the pools of C, N, P and C:N ratio in soil under the E. globulus plantation established on an ex-native forest site. The pools of N and P were also enhanced by N-and-P fertilization in soil from the ex-pasture plantation site, but fertilization had no effect on the amount of total soil organic C or the C:N ratio. For the ex-native forest plantation soil, addition of N fertilizer decreased the pools of exchangeable Ca and Mg, whereas addition of P fertilizer reduced the pool of exchangeable Na. For the ex-pasture plantation soil, P fertilization significantly increased the pool of exchangeable K whereas the pools of exchangeable Ca, Mg and Na were not affected by N, P or N and P fertilization. The pools of C, N, P and exchangeable cations also varied among land uses suggesting that changes in these pools were related to previous land use. For both ex-native forest and ex-pasture plantation soils, addition N fertilizer markedly increased (about twofold) K, and reduced N. Addition of P in the absence of N to the ex-native forest plantation soil reduced cumulative net N mineralization. The relative amounts of CO2-C respired per unit of net N mineralized differed among the land use units. Amounts of net N mineralized (kg ha-1 in 0-200 mm soil) during the initial 28-day aerobic incubation period declined in the order: pasture (29), ex-pasture (18), ex-native forest (14), native forest (3), reflecting the low net N mineralization in native forest soil compared to managed systems. The effects of E. globulus leaf litter on C and net N minneralization in pasture and native forest soils were evaluated using leaching microlysimeters. Cumulative net N mineralization declined in all treatments when litter was added, and was less when leaf litter was mixed with soil. Cumulative CO2-C respired increased with the increasing rate of leaf litter addition, both when leaf litter was mixed through the soil and placed on the soil surface. These increases were associated with increases in microbial biomass C content of soil. In the two plantations soils, microbial biomass C and N were at maximum levels in spring and minimum levels in summer. Addition of P or N-and-P fertilizer reduced the microbial biomass N concentration in the ex-native forest plantation soil, and addition of N and N-and-P fertilizer reduced the microbial biomass N in the ex-pasture plantation soil. Microbial biomass C concentration (kg ha-1 in 0-200 mm soil depth) declined in the order: native forest soil (1018), pasture soil (944), ex-native forest plantation soil (600) and ex-pasture plantation soil (591), whereas microbial biomass N concentration declined in the order: pasture soil (152), native forest (109), ex-native forest soil (84) and ex-pasture soil (83). The soil C fractions were measured using a fractionation procedure based on ease of oxidation with 333 mM potassium permanganate. Soils from adjacent native forest and pasture were sampled and analyzed for C fractions. In the ex-native forest plantation soil, the amount of total soil organic carbon (CT), labile carbon (CL) and nonlabile carbon (C NL) were not affected by addition of either N or P, but were significantly increased by application of N-and-P fertilizer. The carbon pool index (CPI) which reflects changes in the amount of total soil C in fertilized plots relative to the control treatment, and carbon management index (CMI) which relates changes in CPI and the proportion of labile and nonlabile soil C to fertilizer treatments also increased significantly with combined application of N-and-P. By contrast, in the ex-pasture plantation soil, fertilizer amendment had no effect on CT, CL, CNL, CPI or CMI. Further, the soil C fractions, showed that the conversion of native forest or pasture to E. globulus plantations resulted in losses of C relative to the reference soils. This was also reflected in the CPI and CMI, suggesting that eucalypt plantation are likely to result in relative losses of soil C. Rates of N mineralization were predicted using the CenW model and outputs were validated using measured net N mineralized in aerobic laboratory incubations. The CenW model adequately predicted the rates of N mineralization in both the ex-native forest and ex-pasture plantation soils either using long or short-term aerobic laboratory incubations. There was also good agreement between observed and simulated rates of N mineralization when E. globulus leaf litter was added to soil at different rates. In conclusion, the results showed that previous land use and fertilizer treatments had significant influence on the organic matter status of the soil. Moreover, the rate of net N mineralization in both plantation soils differed markedly and these were associated with previous land use. Hence, management strategies to maintain soil fertility and sustainability of the E. globulus plantations must consider past land use and fertilizer history.',NULL,NULL,'Tiu, Wella A.','Environmental

Through a survey of 127 respondents in Laguna, Leyte and Zamboanga del sur, Phase II described the socioeconomic characteristics of coconut farmers raising small ruminants under the plantation, determined the perception of farmer respondents toward the sustainability of the integrated system, and the socioeconomic characteristics related to such perception. The physical environment under the plantation such as light, soil moisture, soil nutrient, and temperature were attributes that determine the sustainability of the feed resources and the productivity of the primary crops. The animal-related variables in sustainability were herd management, animal health aspect and availability of appropriate breeds and breeding animals. The number of household members involved in farming, tenure status, extension support, resource complementation, credit and market were the socioeconomic determinants in the sustainability of the integrated system. In Phase II, the mean age of farm respondents was 47.57 years old and about 2.77 members in the farm household were involved in farming activities. Forty-eight percent of the respondents owned the land they tilled with an average total farm area of 2.8 ha planted to coconut. The average number years in raising small ruminants under coconut plantation was 9.61. Interpersonal contact and radio were the two most commonly accessible sources of information on small ruminant-coconut production system. Majority of the respondents fell under high knowledge category, and had attended training, seminar/lecture more than once. The annual cash income received by respondents was P25, 941.00. Sources of credit were usually the traders, relatives and friends. Coconut was generally sold in buying stations, whereas small ruminants were bought by direct buyers and roving traders. The respondents showed relatively high overall perception score on small ruminant-coconut production system. The number of household members involved in farming, tenure, experience in raising small ruminants, attendance in trainings/seminar, lectures, income from farming and market outlets were significantly related to perception. Sustainability of small ruminant-tree crop/coconut production system should not be limited to crop or animal aspects only. It should consider the interrelationship of the said factors to the physical environment and socioeconomic variables as these determine the basis of the integrated production system.

The testes were ovoid organs covered by the vaginal tunic, thin parietal and thick vicsceral layer. The testes including the epididymis weighed 171.5-334 g and 10.3-11.4 cm wide. Left testis was bigger than the right. Testes and epididymis were prepared for histological observations using paraffin technique, sectioned at 5 um thick with a microtome, and stained with H & E for general histology, masson trichome for collagen fibers, Verhoffs elastin stain for elastic fibers and silver impregnation for reticular fibers. Microscopic observations were done using Nickon electric microscope and measurements of epithelium tubular lumen and stereocilia using  Nickon ocular stage micrometer. The connective tissue of the testes consisted mainly of collagen fibers, blood and lymphatic vessels of various sizes, nerves and fibroblasts. The parenchyma of the testis consisted of seminiferous tubules separated with loose connective tissue, the interstitium. The tubules were lined by two types of cells, the spermatogenic and sertoli cells. The spermatogenic cells consisted of spermatogonia, primary and secondary spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoa. The interstitium consisted mainly of reticular fibers, interstitial cells, blood and lymphatic vessels, nerves and fibroblasts. Interstitial cells occurred singly or in groups near blood vessels. The epididymis consisted of three regions: head, body and tail. The head was attached to the dorsal pole of the testis and continued as the narrowed body loosely attached to the testis forming a pocket, the testicular bursa. The rounded tail was attached to the ventral extremity of the testis by the proper ligament of the testes. Two types of ducts were noted in the head region, the efferent ductules and epididymal duct. The former was lined by low columnar epithelium of columnar, basal and intraepithelial lymphocytes. The epididymal duct from the head, body and tail was lined by a pseudostratified epithelium of columnar, basal, clear and intraepithelial lymphocytes.

The study specifically aimed to (1) characterize the indigenous agroforestry systems of the Jama Mapun in Tawi-Tawi and compare them with the Tausug agroforestry systems in Sulu; (2) determine the major facets of modernization that influence the status of indigenous agroforestry in the two communities; and (3) assess the influence of modernization on farm productivity, stability, equitability and sustainability of indigenous agroforestry in these communities. The methods used were participant observation, farmers\' group discussion and semi-structured interviews. The data analysis was descriptive. However, the performance of the indigenous agroforestry systems was analyzed using the agroecosystem theory of Conway in 1986 and measurement deconstructed from the models outlined by Westman in 1978 for ecosystem resiliency. The results listed at least seven indigenous agroforestry systems. Four were in Sulu and three in Tawi-Tawi. The difference of these systems was on crop spatial arrangement and species planted; cultural maintenance of the farms and their components were relatively the same. The influence of modernization on these farming systems was generally positive. Moreover, the Tausug farmers were more traditional than the Jama Mapun farmers. In terms of production, the Tausug\'s traditional indigenous agroforestry was more productive and sustainable than the Jama Mapun\'s system. The influence of modernization on their agroforestry was not attributed to modern technology but mostly to commercialization, trade and market economy. Identified facets of modernization were working through various domains of transformation in agroforestry. However, their effects were more of conduit that motivates farmers to improve and maintain the indigenous agroforestry technology that exhibited positive impacts on farm productivity, stability, equitability and sustainability.',NULL,NULL,'Tulod, Adrian M.','Pongamia pinnata$xphytoremediation$zMarinduque, Philippines, Samanea saman$xphytoremediation$zMarinduque, Philippines, Vitex parviflora$xphytoremediation$zMarinduque, Philippines, copper attenuation$xsoils',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2018-05-07-02_ab_55636.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(3035,'2021-09-01 07:44:54','2021-09-01 07:44:54','Dynamics of community organizing in two community forestry projects in Region 2.','2021-09-01','The study was conducted among 110 Community Forestry Program (CFP) participants (72 in Bitag Grande, Baggao, Cagayan and 38 in Kadikitan, Landingan, Nagtipunan, Quirino) in Region 2 from December 1995 until March 1996. The objectives were to 1) document, analyze and make a comparative analysis of the processes of community organizing in two community forestry projects, 2) identify the variables that influence the empowerment of people\'s organizations and 3) assess the relationship of the characteristics of members, community and the community organizers in effecting empowerment of people\'s organizations. Retrospective process analysis was used to capture the context and processes of community organizing undertaken in the CFP sites. Data were collected through a combination of individual survey, focused group interviews, direct observation and review of secondary data sources such as monthly, quarterly, annual accomplishment reports of the assisting organizations and minutes of meetings of the Peoples\' Organizations (POs). Descriptive statistics such as means, frequencies, percentages and ranges were used to analyze the independent and dependent variables while Spearman correlation and phi coefficient analyses were done to determine the association of members, community, and Community Organizers\' (COs) characteristics with the measures of empowerment such as decision making, local resource management, linkage, participation and overall empowerment. The significant independent variables were then subjected to multiple regression analysis to identify the major determinants of overall empowerment and its measures. Majority of the respondents perceived a moderate level of empowerment of their POs. Significant factors affecting empowerment measures and overall empowerment varied in the two CFP site. Leadership style, membership in organization, form of communication and COs\' attitude towards the community were the significant factors affecting decision making in Bitag Grande. No variable was significantly related to decision making in Kadikitan. Tenurial status, distance of community to the town proper, need for community organizing, membership in organization and the COs\' skills on organizing, generating resource generation, planning, overall community organizing and technical capability were the significant factors related to local resource management in Bitag Grande. Except for distance of community to the  town proper, all variables were positively related. In Kadikitan, the distance of community to the town, the COs\' organizing skills, resource generation skills, planning skills, overall community organizing skills and technical capability were negatively and significantly associated with local resource management. Only form of communication was positively related. For linkage, the significant variables were distance of community to the town, COs\' organizing and overall community organizing skills and technical capability in Bitag Grande; while in Kadikitan, it was the COs\' organizing skills. Unlike in Bitag Grande where all associations were positive, in Kadikitan it was negative. Educational attainment and overall community organizing skills were the significant factors associated with participation in Bitag Grande while for Kadikitan, household size and need for community organizing. For the overall empowerment, members\' educational attainment, awareness on community organizing, form of communication, COs\' organizing skills, planning skills, overall community organizing skills and attitude towards the community were the significant factors in Bitag Grande. Only form of communication was significant in Kadikitan. Of the above significant variables, the following were the identified major determinants of empowerment in Bitag Grande: membership in organization and COs\' attitude towards the community for decision making; need for community organizing, COs\' organizing skills and COs\' overall community organizing skills for local resource management; technical capability for linkage development; members\' educational attainment for participation; and members\' educational attainment and COs\' attitude towards the community for overall empowerment. In Kadikitan, only local resource management had a significant determinant, i.e., distance of community to the town.

The independent variables were moisture content (MC), compaction load (CL) and binding material (BM) with values ranging from 12% to 28% wet basis; 8,000-12,000 kg; and 0-6%, respectively, laid out in an incomplete factorial design following the three-level-three-parameter design of Box and Behnken in 1960. The important quality attributes of the product analyzed were vertical expansion (mm), compression strength (kg), water holding capacity (%) and final product density (gm/cc). An analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that MC and BM significantly affected vertical expansion and water holding capacity at 1% and 5% levels, respectively. However, these factors did not significantly affect compression strength and final product density. CL was an insignificant factor to any of the four responses within the load range tested. The ANOVA also showed that the second order polynomial (SOP) models generated for vertical expansion and water holding capacity were significant and adequate. On the other hand, statistically insignificant SOP models were generated for compression strength and final product density. Through superimposition of the responses\' contour plots, three optimum condition points were established, namely point A (MC = 15.2%; BM = 0%); point B (MC = 17.6%; BM = 0%) and point C (MC = 20.0%; BM = 0%).

A cottonseed pelletizer was designed, fabricated, and tested at the Cotton Research Center, CODA, Batac, Ilocos Norte. The effect of the three design parameters (inclination angle of the pelletizer chamber, pelletizer drive shaft speed and amount of coating per unit weight of seed) on the pelleting performance and the optimal operating conditions of the machine was determined. The cost and viability of pelleted cottonseeds was also determined. Two types of cottonseed (fuzzy an acid-delinted) were used in the testing. Results showed that all of the pelleting performance parameters were significantly affected by one or more of the design parameters (independent variables). The inclination angle significantly affected the machine\'s pelleting capacity, pelleting efficiency, pure seed pellet recovery and percent loose pellet material. The pelleting chamber inclined at the angle of 5? consistently yielded the best results in pelleting both types of cottonseed used. The drive shaft speed significantly affected the pelleting capacity, efficiency, pure seed pellet, recovery loose pellet material and percent seed singling. Best results were obtained at 155 and 180 rpm. On the other hand, the amount of coating significantly affected all the performance parameters. The optimal condition of the machine as determined using the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) varied from 50 rpm to 180 rpm and the amount of coating ranged from 0.88 kg to 1.75 kg/kg-seed at 5? angle of inclination. Considering the optimal operating condition of 5? combined with 180 rpm and 1.0 kg/kg-seed  amount of coating, the machine\'s pelleting capacity, pelleting efficiency, pure seed pellet recovery, percent loose pelleting material and percent seed singling in pelleting fuzzy cottonseed were 8.14 kg/hour, 95.44%, 98.11%, 10.72% and 93.75%, respectively. Better results were obtained when delinted seeds were pelleted. The storage duration and the amount of coating significantly affected the germination and vigor of the pelleted seeds. Germination and vigor of the pelleted seeds from each type decreased with time. However, no significant variation was observed compared to their control (fuzzy and delinted). The designed machine amounted to P5,100. The computed cost of pelleting a kilogram of cottonseed was P22.62 (51% increase compare to the fuzzy seed). With the improvement in the physical characteristic of the pelleted seed, the labor for seeding could be reduced by 6.6 MD/ha (44.83%) thus, a cost of P705.60/ha (32.10%), could be saved. The break-even point of utilization was estimated to 31.0 kg of pelleted seed per year or equivalent to 1.55 ha/year.

The developed model hoped to ensure that water use does not impair the natural resources capacity to provide life support system on a sustained basis. Specifically, the study aimed to: 1) conduct a rapid water resource balance analysis for the Laguna Water District; 2) assess the issues involved in the evaluation of water supply and demand in the study area; 3) examine the decision-making patterns that influence water production, treatment and distribution tasks of the Water Utility; 4) assess how population needs and ecological concerns are incorporated into the decisions on water production, treatment and distribution; 5) analyze aspects of the water management system in terms of production capacity, water quality and distribution that influence efficiency in water services and 6) recommend measures and strategies to attain sustainable water management and services. The study used a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods in addressing specific research questions. A Water Resource Balance Analysis was conducted to ascertain the water requirements and supply based on varying assumptions. Rough-and ready indicators were used to analyze the efficiency of water management. Qualitative methods included key informant interviews, case study, cross-check and group interviews, and use of documents. The concept of sustainability of water management required a clear understanding of the level of uncertainty in dealing with water availability and assessing supply and demand situations. Available data showed that potential scarcity was brought about by ecological limits as well as the organizational and institutional arrangements in place. The results included a framework that incorporated not only the social and economic concerns but also the protection of the ecosystem that provided water services. This study showcased, in local context the interlocking forces that should be considered when addressing sustainability of water. The complexity of water management underscored the existence of institutional links of a water utility influencing its decision-making process. The viability factors determined to a large extent the capacity of the water utility to explore, abstract and distribute water to target users. Internal operating policies influenced efficiency through decision-making patterns that are also dependent on national policies and organizational requirements to sustain the operations.

Twelve maps of the 18, 960.75 ha watershed were developed using a pixel size of 50 m x 50 m. The Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) was used in computing the rate of erosion. Values of USLE factors were evaluated using different mathematical models. The corresponding values were entered into the IDRISI for Windows software for analysis. The current soil erosion rates at different levels of soil erosion ranged from 0.204 to 144.25 t/ha per year. The average soil loss for the entire watershed was estimated at about 17.24 t/ha per year with the total soil loss of 109,049.72 t/year. The highest current erosion rate was observed on steeper slopes, arable land, clay loam and 84 R-value. The lowest current erosion rate was found on the gentle slopes, secondary forest, sandy loam and 167 R-value. The potential soil erosion rates ranged from 0 t to 200.98 t/ha per year.  The average soil loss for the entire watershed was estimated as 42.077 t/ha per year which translated to 1,753,848.98 t/year. In terms of slope distribution, the lowest potential erosion rate was observed on gentle slopes of the previously river bed area (block 3), clay loam and 84 R-value; while the highest was found on the steeper slopes, previously grassland area (block 4 ), sandy loam and 67 R-value. The  average erosion index of the watershed was 1.683. In terms of slope  distribution, the highest index was estimated in block 4 while the lowest was in block 2. The erosion index less than or equal to one was classified as production areas. On the other hand, the erosion index greater than one was categorized as protection areas. The results showed that about 41.04% was suitable for agricultural purposes while the remaining 58.96% was strictly for protection activities. The study showed that GIS was a powerful tool for determining soil erosion potentials of the study area. GIS made data analysis easier, faster and systematic, among other things.

In study 1, 126 four-week old female ducklings were randomly assigned to six dietary treatments. A 2 x 3 factorial arrangement in a completely randomized design was used to determine the effect of energy (2700 and 2500 kcal ME/kg) and protein (14, 16 and 18%) levels on the growing performance and cost of producing 16- and 18-week old ready-to-lay Philippine Mallard. In study 2, 192 ready-to-lay ducks (96 for each breed) and 24 drakes (12 for each breed) were randomly distributed to 24 pens following a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement in a completely randomized design with three replicates to compare the laying performance and profitability of raising two kinds of mallard ducks fed with two brands of commercial duck layer pellets. The levels of energy and protein of the diets showed no significant interaction on the bi-weekly body weight, bi-weekly cumulative weight gained, daily feed consumption, age when the first egg was laid and weight of first egg of the Philippine Mallard ducks. Neither did the energy level nor the protein levels of the diets significantly affect the above mentioned parameters. Ducks fed the lowest energy and protein diet gave the lowest cost of producing 16- and 18-week old ducks at P 128.50 and P 143.85, respectively. The kind of ducks and brands of feed gave no significant interaction on all the monthly and overall laying performance parameters, except on the overall average weight of the egg produced. The hybrid ducks showed consistently heavier (P<0.05) body weights in all stages of production and greater feed intake compared with the Philippine Mallard ducks. Except for some periods, Philippine Mallard had significantly greater monthly and overall egg production and feed efficiency than hybrid ducks. Ducks fed with feed B had significantly higher feed intake over those fed with feed A on the fourth, sixth months, and overall feed consumption. The breed of duck significantly influenced albumen height of the egg product. The brand of feed significantly affected both the albumen height and yolk color. The breed and sex of duck, and brand of feed showed no significant interaction on the fertility of eggs produced. Philippine Mallard female ducks had significantly greater overall fertility rate than the female hybrid ducks. Likewise, Philippine Mallard drake, consistently and significantly effected higher monthly and overall fertility of eggs than the hybrid drakes. Moreover, brand A pellets had consistently greater monthly and overall fertility of eggs.

The local social development strategy focused on community organizing of the Community-Based Forest Management of the DENR was analyzed in terms of input, communication and community organizing strategy vis-a-vis the people\'s values, attitudes and perceptions. The researcher attempted to explore cultural theories and provided meanings to the participants\' behavior, decision-making and planning for community-based forest management. Result indicated that a community was built upon the relations and feelings of individuals. When basic elements of communication are present, relationship binds, obligates or links one individual to another in pursuit of a common purpose. Such relationship denoted actual pattern of interaction, interdependence and mutual understanding. In this study, the basic element of communication present was the achievement of understanding of what the forest meant to the upland farmers and the next generation. The program promoted such concept with the various modalities that it offered. However, the success of this deliberate action to effect change and support from the community depended on their value system. Their decisions to act were influenced by their understanding of the rewards and penalties of sustainable managing the forests resources; of the problems that concern their community; and of their respective roles as part of the community to address such problems. The study suggested that creation of communities to enlist the participation of people was not merely the formalization of a structure or organization and by appointing officers and members and instituting a set of by laws to which the members were expected to adhere. The creation of community was a process by which ultimately influenced the patterns of relationships of people in the community through the development of new normative system.

At the macro level, trends in importation, sales, tariffs, and prices from 1985 to 1999 were analyzed. At the micro level, an evaluation was made on the changes in use of other inputs, yield, cost and income above material cost in rice production among FFS and non-FFS farmers using PhilRice and IRRI data during the 1994 (representing without regulation) and 1996 (with regulation) dry seasons and 1997 dry and wet seasons. The effects of regulation and FFS on yield were analyzed using the bio-economic and Cobb-Douglas production functions. Insecticide use in the country has generally been increasing as indicated by rising imports and sales in the 1990s. Government tariff and pricing policies reduced the disincentive to use chemicals in agricultural production as indicated by decreasing implicit tariff; but provided higher potential incentive to domestic formulation as indicated by an increasing effective protection rate. Nevertheless, the government appeared to have been successful in minimizing the availability and use of extremely hazardous chemicals in favor of least toxic ones through regulation. At the farm level, regulation had changed the pattern of pesticide use of farmers from Matingkis in Mu?oz, Nueva Ecija. There was a shift from monocrotophos and endosulfan to other chemicals of lower toxicity but these entailed higher volume to compensate for potency loss to attain the equivalent pest control. Farmers\' education as a complementary policy had reduced pesticide use. The FFS farmers in nearby Sto. Domingo, with and without regulation, used insecticide only as a last resort because of better understanding of threshold level. The aggregate cost of material inputs and net income above material cost of farmers were not reduced significantly. But if net income could be improved through appropriate input and pricing policies there would be incentive to continually adopt IPM technology rather than chemical control. In the long run, this could result to healthier population and safer environment. The favorable impact of education on yield was manifested using 1997 data. Yield could be enhanced through farmers\' education based on the result of the estimated bio-economic and Cobb-Douglas production functions. Through time, farmers gained more knowledge and better understanding of the dynamics of the ecosystem that improved their decision making to enhance yield. In view of the positive impact of farmers\' education under continued regulation of harmful chemicals, the government needs to strengthen its efforts to educate more farmers from other areas and in other crops on IPM technology through FFS.',NULL,NULL,'Gonzaga, Apolinario B. jr.','Zea mays, corn$xproductivity$xcropping systems$zNorthern Mindanao, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2018-07-31-05_ab_55831.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(3043,'2021-09-01 07:44:54','2021-09-01 07:44:54','Determination of viability and vigor using accelerated aging technique and electrical leachate conductivity tests for molave (Vitex parviflora Juss) seeds.','2021-09-01','The Accelerated Aging Technique (ATT) was used to assess seed vigor of three molave (Vitex parviflora Juss) seedlots artificially aged seeds at 40?C and 100% relative humidity with various aging periods (0, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192, 216, 240 hours). Vigor of seedlots 1 and 3 declined faster than seedlot 2 at increasing periods of AAT. From an initial percent germination of 64.25%, it increased to 80.50% after 48 hours of AAT. Subsequently, germination decreased to 57.25% and was zero at 168 hours for seedlots 1 and 3 and at 192 hours for seedlot 2. Moisture content (MC) increased with aging time. The increase in MC of the seeds from 16.57% to 22.15% seeds after 24 hours could have triggered some beneficial metabolic processes and advanced the germination of seeds. At the later stage of AAT, high humidity and temperature combinations created adverse conditions and diverse responses such as proliferation of fungal growth, high solute leakage, which eventually led to the death of seeds. At 96 hours of AAT, vigor among seedlots was distinguished. Seed viability and vigor of three molave seedlots was assessed by the electrical conductivity of the leachates using HACH 44600 TDS/Conductivity Model. This was done by soaking samples of 50 seeds for 24 hours in 100 ml distilled water. Seed leachate conductivity when regressed with viability and vigor was linearly and inversely related. Similarly, significant and high correlations were obtained between viability and vigor on conductivity measurements. The computation of germination value by Djavanshir and Pourbeik method was observed to be a better index of vigor than the peak values and germination values by Czabator.

The general histology of the oviduct was the same in all three groups of birds. Mucosal folds were present in the entire oviduct in all the three groups but were most numerous and extensive in the uterus or shell gland and least prominent in the infundibulum. Various patterns of mucosal folds in each oviductal segment were noted (e.g. tall and short in the infundibulum, very broad in the magnum, broad with epithelial folds and crypts in the isthmus, long and tortuous in the uterus, and tall with secondary folds in the vagina). There was a lamina propria-tunica submucosa because of the absence of muscularis mucosa. As expected, the lamina propria-submucosa of the entire oviduct contained tubular glands. In the vagina, these glands were called sperm host glands or sperm storage tubules. Two types of lining epithelium were noted, namely, a) simple columnar-ciliated cells which was present in the infundibulum and b) pseudostratified columnar-ciliated cells in the magnum, isthmus, uterus and vagina. The tunica muscularis was most developed in the vagina and least developed in the infundibulum. The uterus showed the most developed inner circular and outer longitudinal layers separated by stratum vasculare. The serosa was typical in all segments. Collagen was present while elastic fibers were absent in the entire oviduct. Histochemically, only the lining epithelium reacted to the special stains: a) calcium salts was observed only in the shell gland of laying native chickens, b) neutral and sulfated mucosubstances were present in the epithelia of the magnum and vagina in all three groups; these substances were particularly abundant in the magnum of laying and brooding chickens, c) mucin was present in the magnum in all birds, and d) glycogen or glycoprotein was present in the magnum, isthmus and vagina of incubating chickens.

The majority were owners with an average farm size of 6 ha, an average annual fiber production of 280.37 kg/ha and an average annual income of P7, 075.47. Most of them were members of formal farmers\' associations. However, they had limited extension contacts with technicians. Most of the farmers had inadequate abaca production credit. Almost one-half did not believe that inputs could  increase yields. The majority cultivated a combination of abaca varieties. They harvested fibers twice per year and practiced the hand-stripping method. Most farmers marketed all-in fibers anytime to town dealers because of accessibility on cash basis. The majority had positive attitudes toward the FIDA,  but had low aspirations in life. The majority of the farmers were low adoptors, utilizing only 8 out of 20 recommended production practices. The correlates of low adoption were: tenure status cum poor sharing arrangement, inadequate production credit, harvesting practices and market outlets.

The plantation area was delineated according to clump productivity classes, namely, 1) highly productive (>20 culms/clump); 2) fairly productive (10-20 culms/clump) and 3) marginally productive (<10 culms/clump). In each strata, soil and plant tissue sampling and analyses, destructive cutting/harvesting of culms of specific age to estimate the aboveground biomass of individual clump, measurement of culm basal diameter and height, charting of clumps and counting of the actual number of culms/clump and detailed soil morphological characterization were undertaken. The data were subjected to regression and correlation analyses and analysis of variance. The Kauayan tinik clumps in the highly productive site (footslope, 5-10%) developed fast and yielded an average of 26.7 culms/clump of large size and superior quality. The fresh biomass of 826.42 kg/clump was composed of 7.58, 2.43 and 76.97% of leaves, branches and culms, respectively.  Conversely, clump development was very slow in the marginal site (hillside, >100% slope) producing only about 8.0 culms and 62.87 kg fresh biomass/clump eight years after planting. Regardless of site, the concentration of N, P, K, Ca and Mg was greater in the leaves than in the branches and in the culms. However, the culms accumulated > 50% of the total nutrient uptake because it comprised > 50% of the total aboveground biomass. The relative humidity and soil pH had regulated the productivity of Kauayan tinik in Bukidnon. Biomass production and culm basal diameter/height were exponentially related. Positive logarithmic relationships occurred between the culm/biomass production and culm height/soil, pH/available, P/exchangeable cations (K+, Ca++ , Mg++)/CEC. Culm/biomass production was negatively correlated with the relative humidity and soil N. Results strongly indicated that the high productivity of Kauayan tinik clumps was mainly caused by low clay content and suitable soil pH. The highly productive site was potentially sustainable because of its early and relatively fast clump development. The properties and conditions of the soil in the area were, therefore, ideal for bamboo production. Conversely, the relatively poor productivity of the species in the marginal site was attributable to very low pH, aluminum toxicity, very steep slope and high clay content.',NULL,NULL,'Nicdao, Anthony C.','sweet sorghum seeder$xagricultural machinery, fertilizer applicator$xagricultural machinery, agricultural engineering, Engineering',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2018-04-20-04_ab_55675.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(3047,'2021-09-01 07:44:54','2021-09-01 07:44:54','Exposure to DMMMSU-PCARRD\'s bamboo program and the knowledge, attitudes and practices on bamboo (Bambusa blumeana Schultes) production of selected farmers in Bacnotan, La Union.','2021-09-01','The study aimed to determine the effects of the DMMMSU-PCARRD Bamboo Program on the knowledge, attitudes and practices on bamboo planting of farmers in Bacnotan, La Union. A total of 44 bamboo farmers were interviewed. The data were analyzed using descriptive methods and inferential statistics. Relationships were analyzed using chi-square and Spearman\'s Correlation Coefficient at 0.05% level of significance. Results showed that exposure to the Bamboo Program had a significant relationship with farmer\'s knowledge and attitudes, but not with their practices on planting bamboo. Attitudes were positively correlated with nominative influences, perceptions/beliefs and experiences. Training and visitation services were more effective than cross-farm visits and publications in influencing the farmers to adopt the technology because of the hands-on experience. Farmers adopted the technology because of the following: 1) They wanted to find out whether or not the technology was effective; 2) They realized the need to help prevent soil erosion and take part in environmental protection; 3) The technology was effective, procedure was easy to follow, and stocks were easy to handle and 4) They wanted to increase bamboo production because of bamboo\'s many uses. Eight months after the program ended, 56.7% confirmed they are still planting bamboos. Reasons cited were for environmental protection, for reproduction of planting stocks, the many uses of bamboos, effectiveness of the technology, the relatively fast growth of bamboos and the ease of propagation and the promising future of bamboo production.',NULL,NULL,'Mabayag, Corsennie A.','rice $xplant production$zAgusan del Norte, Philippines, Oryza sativa, growth, meteorological factors$xplant production, rice $xproductivity, planting dates$xrice, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2018-05-03-05_ab_55683.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(3048,'2021-09-01 07:44:54','2021-09-01 07:44:54','Critical theory as an alternative in analyzing upland development discourse in Mindoro.','2021-09-01','This study was conducted in the island of Mindoro in the areas covered by the Low Income Upland Community Project (LIUCP). Of the eight watershed covered by the project, two were used as case study sites: the Malaylay-Bucayao watersheds in Oriental Mindoro and the Abra de Ilog watershed in Occidental Mindoro. The study\'s primary concern was to apply/use the critical theory (Habermasian Approach) as method in analyzing natural resources and environmentally related projects like the LIUCP which was an upland development intervention in the island of Mindoro. The project\'s component helped the target beneficiaries realize their desire to be empowered. The provision of basic social services like roads, water, education, and health service facilities and the availability of alternative employment, which led to the increase in their income, helped the project participants in their fight against poverty. The community organizing component made the participants more self-reliant and responsible partner of the government in the protection and conservation of the forest and the uplands, in general, as evidenced by their active participation in the different income-generating activities and the initiatives of the people\'s organizations to act as guardians of the uplands. Despite the project\'s good intention, however, it created some major issues of concern especially on the part of the Mangyan beneficiaries. These issues were related to the fast erosion of their traditional culture and the change of forest cover from indigenous species to exotic ones. While the project had identified the Mangyans and the upland migrants as its direct beneficiaries, it was found out that in the long run, the lowlanders might benefit most from LIUCP; this was considering that the areas covered by the project were watersheds that drain to areas beyond the project boundary. In the methodology, critical theory was applicable in this policy subject. The method provided opportunity to determine the events that caused such conditions to happen and to reason out why these happened. A major drawback of the method, however, was the lack of standards and procedures that would help better understand the policy issues or to come with solutions to policy problems.

The study was conducted in three severely affected barangays of Tarlac Province, namely: Brgy. Culubasa in Bamban, Brgy. Lilibangan in Concepcion, and Brgy. Sta. Juliana in Capas. Vegetation analysis was done using the Line Intercept Technique. Lahar samples were analyzed at the Bureau of Soil and Water Management. The results of the analyses were compared with results of previous studies in the sites. Key informant interview was used to gather socioeconomic variables and descriptive statistics was used to analyze the socioeconomic data. Thirty farmer-key informants were interviewed for the study. The adaptive agricultural strategies were evaluated in terms of productivity/profitability, number of farmers involved, farm size, length of utilization, enhancing policy/program and stability. The landscape and lifescape dynamics were assessed using time line and trend analyses. The vegetation changed in dominance and composition in the study sites except for Brgy. Lilibangan where Saccharum spontaneum remained the dominant species. Imperata cylindrica was the dominant species in Brgy. Culubasa and Lantana camara dominated the sample plots in Brgy. Sta. Juliana in 2002. Both sites were dominated with S. spontaneum in 1993. In terms of plant composition, five species (Phragmaetis vulgaris, Mikania micrantha, Typha latifolia, Euphorbia pilufera, and Solanum ferox) found growing in Brgy. Culubasa in 1993 were already absent in 2002. Another five new species, however, (Stylosanthes guyanensis, I. cylindrica, Digitaria longiflora, Tridax procumbens and Cynodon dactylon) were observed in 2002. In Brgy. Lilibangan, four new plant species were found while three former plant species were no longer there. In Brgy. Sta. Juliana where an advancing succession was observed, seven new species were found in 2002 while only one of those recorded in 1993 was absent. The texture of lahar had not changed, sand to sandy loam with very low waterholding capacity. A very slight change in the chemical properties was, however, observed. Organic matter was consistently very low in all sites, although, it improved in Brgy. Sta. Juliana where an advancing stage of plant succession was observed. Macro and micronutrients were deficient in all sites. The major agricultural practices in the sites, except for Brgy. Sta. Juliana where the farmers resorted to the uplands, were rice farming, sweet potato and sugarcane farming. Rice farming was not yet a stable crop production system in the lahar areas at the time of the study. Nevertheless, yield from rice slightly improved beginning 1996 when groundwater was tapped for irrigation. On the other hand, sweet potato was found to be a viable farming practice of the farmers in the lahar-covered areas but highly unstable market price of sweet potato tubers threatened it\'s stability. At the moment, leasing out the lahar-covered farms to the sugarcane producers is apparently the most economically viable strategy among farmers in all the study sites. The study also revealed a different pattern of vegetation change a similar pattern of change in the agricultural practices in all study sites except in Brgy. Sta. Juliana where farming was shifted to the uplands. No relationship was noted on the changes in vegetation and agricultural practices.

Rosa. The objectives were to: (1) determine how public participation was operationalized in the various stages of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process; (2) find out how decision-making took place within the EIA process and how the public contributed to the decision-making; (3) analyze the factors which influenced public participation in the  EIA process; (4) find out the factors that influence social acceptability of the project and (5) formulate measures to enhance public participation in the various stages of the Philippine EIA process. Retrospective process analysis was utilized to capture the processes of public participation in EIA. Secondary information constituted the principal database which provided the basis for selecting the projects for in-depth case study. The information in the in-depth study were gathered both by individual survey and key informants interview. Descriptive statistics, Spearman correlation and t-test were used to analyze data. Even though the participation of stakeholders went in various aspects of EIA process, public participation was not  carried out for three case studies (i.e. ESPP, MVS,  and RCAS). In the FBPP the public was involved in the EIA process, but their involvement was limited to screening, scoping, mitigation and reporting stages only.  Nonetheless, public participation contributed to the project social acceptability. Scoping had significant contribution to decision making. In this stage, the public disclosed all possible impacts and implications of the proposed poject. Although public participation in scoping was limited to information sharing and consultation, such mechanisms influenced decision making. Access to information and level of awareness of the community members, among several community characteristics tested, were identified determinants of public participation. The greater access to information was public participation. On the other hand, determinants of social acceptability of the project were community power structure, leadership style, access to information and level of awareness.

Results showed that 60% of the population were Aetas and the rest  were non-Aetas (Tagalogs, Visayans, Bicolanos). Farmlots were privately managed while forest resources growing in open areas such as bamboos, cogon and residual trees were communally managed by the Kanawan Negrito community. Major crops planted in farmlots included bananas and sweet potatoes. The different organizations created institutional incentives such as land security, market opportunities, education, training and skills development and support services to the Aeta community. When the community adopted the incentives the organizations gave, both positive and negative consequences  occurred. With respect to positive consequences, land security was improved, there was better market opportunities, increased area cultivated, diversified livelihood activities and high regard to education. On the other hand, the negative consequences included increased migration, land fragmentation, nonadoption of agroforestry, SALT and some provisions of CFSA and low level of community cohesion. The study recommended that assisting organizations provide institutional incentives that will, (1) establish a common leader in the community who will facilitate coordination among resources users to avoid conflicts and (2) provide continuing guidance in the implementation of accepted development plan until such time that the community can manage on their own.',NULL,NULL,'Tutor, Jose Ariel A.','Silviculture$zWestern Visayas, public gardens$xsilviculture$zWestern Visayas, public parks$xsilviculture$zWestern visayas, floral attributes$xpublic parks$xpublic gardens$zWestern Visayas',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2018-05-11-05_ab_55649.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(3052,'2021-09-01 07:44:54','2021-09-01 07:44:54','The dicot flora on the western slopes of Mt.

Seventy families in the collection were eudicots and five were paleodicots. The most number of speciose collected were Moraceae, Apocynaceae, Dipterocarpaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Urticaceae, Clusiaceae, Myrsinaceae, Lamiaceae, Piperaceae, Meliaceae and Myrtaceae. Fifty-three percent of the species were trees, 27% shrubs, 15% vines and epiphytes, and 15% herbs. Thirty-one percent were Philippine endemics. The flora was characteristically Malesian with a few Asiatic and Australian types. Four altitudinal vegetation zones were identified. Zone I was the most luxuriant with a well-developed tree, shrub and herb layers. Zone II was a high forest dominated by tall and large trees, mostly dipterocarps with a generally impoverished ground flora. Zone III had fewer and slightly shorter trees but with an increasing number of epiphytes. Zone IV, the summit zone was a mossy forest having short, crooked trees laden with bryophytes and epiphytes. Zone I, Stercula-Voacanga-Acalypha-Elatostema association, occurred at 90-300 m asl and had 77, 29, 24, and 7 species of trees, shrubs, vines and epiphytes, and herbs, respectively. Thirty-two dicot species (e.g. Stercula rubiginosa, Voacanga globosa, etc.) were preferential to the zone. Zone II or the Discocalyx-Psychotria-Phyllanthus-Canarium association, occurred at 300-600 m. Eighty-one tree species, together with 47 shrubs, 23 lianas and epiphytes, and 8 herbs were found. The preferentials included Hopea malibato, Anisoptera thurifera and Canarium asperum. Zone II, Greeniopsis-Acmena-Calophyllum-Elaeocarpus association occurring at 600-900 m had 34, 24, 4, and 4 species of dicot trees, shrubs, lianas/epiphytes and herbs, respectively. Shorea guiso and S. plagata were the tallest but S. guiso was the largest. Zone IV, Syzygium-Astronia-Hedyotis-Argostemma association, was a mossy forest at 1,000 m up to the peak of 1,158 m. It was home to 19 species of trees, 7 shrubs, 5 lianas/epiphytes and 1 herb. Astronia candolleana, Syzygium sp., Vaccinium myrtoides, Hedyotis elmeri, Drimys piperita, etc. characterized this zone. Zones I and II, as well as Zones II and III, were the most floristically similar with 35 and 39 common species, respectively. The most distant were Zones I and IV as well as II and IV. Species diversity decreased with altitude, Zone I being the most diverse and Zone IV, the least. Calophyllum blancoi and Psychotria diffusa were adapted to all elevations; Ardisia squamulosa, Sarcandra glabra, and Symplocos polyandra thrived at the three upper zones; Shorea negrosensis, S. palosapis, Osmoxylon trilobatum, Polyscias nodosa, Helicia robusta and Procris frutescens occurred from Zone I to Zone III.

Narra height growth, dry matter production, nodulation, VA mycorrhizal spore population, nutrient concentration and uptake (particularly N and P), soil CEC and soil pH were reduced when soil was sterilized. The degree of soil pH change was, however, slight which might also have unaffected other factors such as VAM root infection, diameter growth and root-shoot ratio. Inoculation with VAM and Rhizobium promoted heavier nodulation, greater sporulation and VAM root infection, which in turn increased the yield of dry matter, shoot weight more than root weight, height growth and the uptake of nutrients. Generally, inoculation reduced N and P content and increased in cation exchange capacity in Macolod soil while soil pH remained unaffected. Dual inoculation using Glomus macrocarpum + Rhizobium was best for narra based on 25 variables tested. In the association, Rhizobium consistently gave higher percent contribution to the plant than the mycorrhizal counterpart. Inoculation with the best symbionts produced taller, more vigorous and more drought-tolerant narra seedlings, which could be accounted to structural and functional improvements in the host plant. Morpho-anatomical changes included  leaf weight, root density, wood vessel frequency and diameter. Increased in nutrient concentration and uptake in inoculated plants were highly correlated with improvements in wood vessel characteristics. Inoculation increased total plant transpiration, elevated osmotic pressure, delayed the point of incipient plasmolysis, which resulted in higher tissue content at lower water potential. Plant biochemical responses such as lower production of proline, increased starch content and reduction in sugar content might also explain the slight degree of plant water stress in inoculated narra under soil moisture deficit. Inoculation and moderate water stress enhanced microbial colonization, promoted effective N-fixation, improved the water relations, plant growth and yield of narra. Height growth, biomass and nutrient uptake in narra were increased by the application of fertilizer and/or inoculation. Inorganic fertilizer suppressed mycorrhizal root infection, reduced soil pH but increased soil P. While maximum yield of 200% were effected by 60 kg N/ha plus 60 kg P/ha or mycorrhiza plus 60 kg N, an optimum yield of 150% could be obtained with inoculation using the best symbionts but which could give the highest fertilizer savings of 60 kg N/ha plus 30 kg P/ha.',NULL,NULL,'Cabarles, Jaime C., Jr.','chickens$zWestern Visayas, Philippines, Gallus gallus domesticus, phenotypes, biodiversity, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2018-07-04-04_ab_55717.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(3054,'2021-09-01 07:44:54','2021-09-01 07:44:54','Transactional arrangements between cultflower and ornamental technology generators and selected organized growers in Laguna.','2021-09-01','This study described and analyzed the transactional arrangements between Postharvest Horticulture Technology Training Research Center (PHTRC) and growers in postharvest technology development of cut flowers and ornamentals in Laguna. Specifically, it aimed to : 1) characterize the research and extension (R&E) service of PHTRC, 2) describe the characteristics of technology utilizers in terms of their level of production, marketing and financing, 3) assess the effectiveness of extension support services extended by the technology generators (PHTRC) and 4) analyze the mechanisms of participatory technology development (TD) process such as technology generation (TG), technology dissemination (TD) and technology utilization (TU). Eighty-seven grower respondents were drawn from the list of 8 cooperative growers and 15 PHTRC-staff respondents. Data were gathered using an interview schedule. Majority of PHTRC-staff respondents developed fruit crops postharvest technology and only one respondent was able to develop postharvest technology (PHT) of cut flowers. All PHTRC staff were involved  in the technology dissemination process frequently as resource persons. Most of the respondents were orchid and anthurium growers with the area planted ranging from 50 sq m to 10,000 sq m. No serious problems on production were mentioned except for insect pests/diseases, theft and low production mentioned by few. Most of the respondents sold their produce to flower shops, wholesalers, and few to final consumers on cash basis. Buyers, usually picked up the produce from the growers\' residence. Majority of the respondents sorted their produce according to size, spike length and color and most of them did no use preservation technique. Few respondents encountered problems on low pries, irregular buyers and lack of marketing outlets. Growers provided their own capital and only few availed of financial aid from their respective cooperatives. The grower-respondents perceived the PHTRC programs and extension support sources as very useful and adequate. Similarly, a great majority wanted to attend training on cut flowers while half obtained PHT information from PHTRC training manual. The transactional arrangements or mechanisms in participatory technology development processes involved PHTRC-grower activities related to TG, TD and TU. In such activities, findings showed that 93% and 41% of the PHTRC- and grower-respondents, respectively, participated in the activities related to TG, TD and TU specified in the existing memorandum of agreement (MOA). Likewise, organizational activities calling for participation such as meeting and consultations were better mechanisms for organizational actions. Other mechanisms suggested were garden shows and resource-sharing. Sustainability of linkages in R&E was measured in terms of the rate of participation in meeting basics farm needs, linkage maintenance, improvement of extension strategies and contribution to reduction of economic wastages/losses. Grower respondents met their farm needs specifically those relevant to applicable technology and market exposure through the help of PHTRC. Linkage maintenance and improvement of extension strategies were perceived as high for those who have participated in PHTRC programs. Wastage reduction was perceived to have contributed economically to the success of the postharvest programs. Spearman Rank Correlation showed that area utilized, volume harvested, percentage sold to buyers were significantly related with the sustainability of linkages in  R&E. Likewise, chi-square test results for participation in TG and TD, presence of MOA and organizational activities were significantly associated with the sustainability of linkages in R&E.

The physical, chemical and microbiological properties of soils studied were analyzed. The microbial population were counted using the agar plate method. The nutrifiers were enumerated using the Most Probable Number method. The soil enzymatic activities measured were urease, phosphomonoesterases and dehydrogenase activity. The populations of bacteria, molds, yeast and actinomycetes varied among soils. The bacterial count, fungal count and actinomycetes count were observed in cultivated soil adjacent to forest soil, paddy soil with composted straw for two years and upland soil under alley cropping with mulching and with hedgerows, respectively. Some of the genera identified were Aspergillus, Peniccilium and Fusarium. Forest soils had the highest soil urease activity (SUA). The SUA was significantly correlated with soil organic matter (SOM) (r = 0.69*), cation exchange capacity (r = 0.66*) and total N (r = 0.84**). The acid and alkaline phosphatase activities showed a high value except SOIL 11, paddy soil with azolla. The dehydrogenase activity was highest in forest soil and lowest in upland soil under farmers\' practice. It was not correlated with SOM.

Based on their taxonomic classification, the lowland soils in North Cotabato belonged to five soil orders, namely, Histosols, Mollisols, Inceptisols, Alfisols and Entisols. In South Cotabato, the lowland rice fields were classfied as Entisols, Inceptisols and Alfisols. The evaluation results of the different land units showed that most of the lowland rice fields of North Cotabato manifested high productivity potential despite the drainage constraint. The average predicted inherent yield of Mollisols was 5.53 t/ha but the predicted maximum possible yield could be as high as 6.5 t/ha. Maximum possible yield signified the capability of the soils to produce 6.5 t/ha if corrective measures to limitations were allotted in that particular land unit. The entisols of South Cotabato had low predicted inherent yield of 2.27 t/ha only. The soils had low nutrient availability and retention. The Inseptisols had the highest predicted inherent yield of 5.0 t/ha. Yield gap analysis that the most serious limitation of the land qualities of Mollisols in North Cotabato was drainage. The drainage problem affected the productivity in two ways: flooding hazard caused by poor surface drainage and waterlogging resulting in organic acid accumulations. Another constraint identified in North Cotabato was the high relative humidity, which contributed to the high incidence of insect pests and diseases. The farmers\' actual yield in North Cotabato was below the predicted possible yield despite the inherent fertility of the soil because of pests especially during the wet season. The farmers\' average yield was only 4.0 t/ha but the maximum possible yield in Mollisols was 6.5t/ha; Inceptisols, 5.4 t/ha; and Alfisols, 4.3 t/ha. The yield  gap ranged from 7% to 39%. In South  Cotabato, the major constraints identified were low nutrient availability and retention. This limitation was brought about by the coarse texture of the soils and mineralogy and can be corrected with fertilizer application. The farmers\' average yield was 5.0 t/ha because they applied higher fertilizer rates and used certified seeds of high yielding varieties. Moreover, rice-growing areas of South Cotabato (81.2%) had favorable relative humidity than those of North Cotabato (87.03%). Yields in South Cotabato were at their maximum level. The technology requirements in North Cotabato included proper drainage, techniques in minimizing the toxic effects of organic acids, and high yielding varieties resistant to tungro and black bag. In South Cotabato, the timing of fertilizer application to avoid leaching was very critical. Varieties with higher genetic potential and resistance to pests should be made available to increase the present yield level.',NULL,NULL,'Caldo, Kristian Mark P.','Agriculture, coconut, Cocos nucifera, biochemistry, cloning, 11S globulin gene, globulins',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2018-09-11-03_ab_55738.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(3057,'2021-09-01 07:44:54','2021-09-01 07:44:54','Evaluation of species suitability of established reforestation areas at Ganano Watershed, Diffun, Quirino, Philippines.','2021-09-01','This study evaluated the effectiveness of the current reforestation program for the Ganano Watershed at Diffun, Quirino with emphasis on species suitability assessment. The methodology included soil and social surveys, manual and computer-aided mapping, species suitability assessment, linear program modeling and hydrologic impact assessment. A total of 141 soil samples were collected, processed and analyzed. Social surveys were conducted with the use of prepared questionnaires substantiated with personal interviews. A total of 171  respondents composed of 154 farmers and 17 wood processors were interviewed. Secondary data were gathered from reports, publications and maps found in various offices and institutions. Weather data from three weather stations, collected from 1995 to 1999, which included daily rainfall, daily maximum and minimum temperatures, were used. A total of 15 thematic maps were digitized, edited, rasterized, captured and subsequently exported to computer program IDRISI as image files for analysis. Farmers in Ganano Watershed vary in their outlooks on tree plantation development. Those interested (46.75%) were motivated most by the prospect of a future  income; those with reservations (45.46%) were indecisive to venture because of their small landholdings, and those disinterested (7.79%) were inhibited mainly because of the absence of title to the land they are cultivating. The main problem of wood processors was scarcity of finances. Species preferences by farmers and wood processors were reflective of their needs and intentions. From a prioritized list of 13 reforestation species preferred by both groups, four were selected and assessed of their suitability. They were gmelina, carabao mango, mahogany and Benguet pine. Out of these, the only suited species and their total suitable area in Gagano Watershed were gmelina, 8,513.57 ha.; carabao mango, 1,359.50 ha and mahogany, 1,146.50 ha. The suitable area of carabao mango totally overlapped with that of gmelina. The size and distribution of suitable areas of each species were evaluated as to political jurisdiction, land use and Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) projects. Within DENR projects, the areas suited to species were gmelina, 2,848.50 ha; carabao mango, 238.50 ha and mahogany, 17.50 ha.  Species preferences of people did not have a good match with the distribution of suitable areas of their chosen species in their barangays. The result of species suitability assessment for gmelina was validated on 10-year-old plantations of the species located within the watershed. The analysis showed that areas mapped as suitable and unsuitable were significantly different from each other based on their total merchantable volume but not on the survival percentage and total height of trees. The resources found limiting were the area suited to mahogany and carabao mango and the permissible soil loss. Future effects of reforestation on the hydrology of the watershed two to three years after plantation establishment are increase in evapotranspiration loss and soil moisture storage within the root zone, decrease in soil moisture storage within the unsaturated zone and runoff and unaffected groundwater storage. The idea of  taking the habitat as the suitable area in species suitability assessment is new and needs further examination.

Specifically, the study was conducted to: a) develop site index models for palasan (Calamus merrillii, Becc.) based on some measurable environmental factors; b) determine the relationship between and among environmental factors and growth of palasan and c) recommend measures for the efficient management of rattan palasan. Five dominant cane lengths of palasan per plot were measured while soil samples were collected for laboratory analysis. Correlation and regression analyses were done using a Statistical Analysis System. The palasan had an average age of 8.5 years and average dominant cane length of 10.21 m. Average annual cane length increment was 1.08 m. Its growth increased up to 11th year and started to taper off on the 12th year. This indicated that the rotation age of palasan was 11 years. Its diameter remained static from 3.3 cm to 4.64 cm. Average sucket production was only 2.5 culms per clump and was negatively influenced strongly by manganese content of the soils. Topographic position had an important bearing on the growth of palasan. Cane length growth were promoted at valley bottom where greater percentage of silt and sand were deposited than at the middle or upper slope. Total cane length growth of palasan was favorably influenced by acidic condition, i.e., significantly increasing growth from pH 6.3 to pH 4.0. Magnesium and, to some extent, calcium depressed cane length growth. Basal area of the host tree stand positively affected cane length growth of palasan. Using the relationship of dominant total cane length and age, the best estimate of site quality was:	Log SI = Log CL + B1 (1/BAGE = 1/A)	   Where  :   SI = Site Index	             BAGE = Reference base age, in this                                                  study = 10 years		    CL= dominant cane length in meters		    A = Age (in years)		   B1 = Parameter	                                                        Log= Logarithm to the base 10However, integrating the environmental variables, the best environment site index model selected is of the form:	ESI = 24.39 + (2.439* A) - (1.2458 * TP) + CL	Where:  ESI = Environment Site Index		 A = Age (in years)	             TP = Topographic Position	             CL = Cane Length (in meters)Comparison of the two models showed a peculiarity for ESI to underestimate the predicted dominant cane length. The study recommended a refinement by increasing the number of samples to cover more areas and consequently to increase the accuracy of the prediction model. Nevertheless, findings from this study indicated that topographic position alone may be an adequate site indicator for palasan. The models developed were statistically valid and applicable only under Talacogon condition.

The willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept (WTA) compensation were used as measures to estimate the use and nonuse value of wildlife preservation using a total of 396 respondents from on-site and off-site communities. Likewise, benefit-cost analysis was conducted to determine the economic efficiency of the project. The study successfully implemented CVM for measuring WTP and WTA compensation for the preservation of wildlife resources. The logistic regression analysis showed that off-site respondent\'s decision to pay for the preservation of wildlife was significantly affected by income and awareness to the wildlife species in the national park. Likewise, respondents\' age, household size and membership in organization were the factors that significantly affected the on-site respondents\' decision to accept compensation. The decision on how much compensation the respondents were willing to pay and willing to accept for the preservation of wildlife was done using linear regression analysis. Sex, income, education and occupational group were among the factors that influenced the amount of the respondents\' WTP for wildlife preservation. For on-site respondents, the factors that significantly affected the amount of the respondents\' WTA compensation were farm income and age. CVM also performed well in estimating use and nonuse values of wildlife preservation. Linear regression determined the factors affecting WTP. For use values, WTP for direct use value was significantly affected by sex, income and age. Income, education and occupational group were among the significant factors that affected WTP for indirect use values, while WTP for option value was related to income and education. Likewise, in estimating nonuse values, WTP for existence values was significantly affected by income and awareness of the wildlife resources while income and education were among the significant variables that affected WTP for bequest values. Results of the benefit-cost analysis showed that preserving wildlife resources for the next 30 years was not economically feasible based on the computed NPV (P108,750,108.37) and BCR (0.68) at 10.25% interest rate. The low NPV and BCR values were attributed to the limited wildlife species studied and the relatively high WTA bids. Based on the results, the following were the suggested policy recommendations: further strengthening DENR alternative livelihood projects; continuous education campaign on the importance of wildlife including the benefits obtained from its protection by the DENR in cooperation with line agencies, NGOs, etc; apportioning increase in rental and entrance fees specifically to wildlife preservation programs; imposition of stricter laws on occupancy and other laws on wildlife preservation; and, follow-up researches on the general application of the approach to analysis of the preservation values to other forest resources.',NULL,NULL,'Sagun, Julius Ver M.','eIF4G gene, biotechnology, molecular biology, rice$xmolecular characterization, Biology',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2018-10-03-03_ab_55828.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(3060,'2021-09-01 07:44:54','2021-09-01 07:44:54','Dehydration of mango (Mangifera indica L.) using microwave heating and air convection drying.','2021-09-01','This study determined the effect of microwave heating and forced air convection as heat and mass transfer agents in dehydrating mango. Specifically, the study evaluated a dehydration process and determined the parameters necessary to produce dehydrated mango. It also compared the identified process with the conventional heated air drying in terms of moisture reduction rates and drying curves. Results showed that the dehydration processes using the alternate microwave heating and air convection drying set at 140 watts microwave power, and the simultaneous microwave heating and air convection drying set at 280 watts microwave power could dry mango in shorter time as compared to conventional heated air drying method. The processes mentioned had an average drying rate of 0.227% moisture content (MC) per minute while that of conventional method had 0.107% MC/minute. The processes could reduce moisture by 0.12% MC/minute, which was about 53% decrease in the drying time. Hence, the drying time of 16-20 hours for conventional drying could be reduced using the above system by eight to ten hours. The system used 140 and 280 watts microwave power, 45?-75?C for lower and upper product temperature limits and 2.5 cu m/minute at 45?C heated air. The study also showed a temperature-time distribution of the processes, which consisted of cycles and subcycles of temperatures change resulting from microwave exposure. The system specific heating capacities (Hmw) for mango were determined at different microwave power levels. The Hmw could be used in upscaling the system for commercial applications. The fast rate of moisture reduction in mango using the microwave energy and heated air could also be used in other fruits and vegetables.

Generally, the application of the 6 t/ha calcitic lime, which increased soil pH from 4.5 to 5.98 at harvest, favored the growth of Phil 8839 sugarcane variety. However, plant height, stalk length and diameter at harvest, total number of millable stalks at harvest, and weight/stalk at harvest did not differ significantly among treatments. On the other hand, the number of tillers was significantly reduced with the application of 6 t/ha calcitic or dolomitic lime as compared to no lime application. Among the macronutrients, only soil exchangeable potassium was significantly influenced by liming. Soil exchangeable potassium at harvest decreased significantly as a result of calcitic lime application irrespective of the rates as compared to no lime application. On the other hand, soil applied with 6 t/ha dolomitic lime contained similar exchangeable potassium with the unlimed soil. In this experiment, the higher the amount of calcitic lime applied, the bigger was the increase in pH, resulting in the significant reduction of soil exchangeable Mn and Al. The same observation was noted with the use of 6 t/ha dolomitic lime. The PS/TC was not significantly affected by lime application. On the other hand, cane yield (TC/ha) of plants treated with 3 and 6 t/ha calcitic lime were significantly high because of significantly higher stalk weight per plot.

Seedlings and suckers were collected from Zamboanga del Sur and were subjected to predetermined treatments when they were at the late seedling stage, about 24 months old. The experiment was a 3 x 3 factorial in randomized complete block design (RCBD). The seedlings and suckers were exposed to varying light and watering treatments in fabricated growth cages for seven months. Periodic data collection on net assimilation rate (NAR), relative water content (RWC), soil water content (SWC), and height and root collar diameter (RCD) were taken. The final height, RCD, number of leaves, total biomass, root density, shoot-root ratio, leaflet area, number of leaflets per leaf were taken to evaluate the response of palasan to the imposed treatments. Other responses, such as stomatal density, size and behavior, were assessed. Also, the biochemical parameters like sugar, starch and proline content were analyzed. Among the different light intensities imposed upon the test plants, low light (50-60%) resulted in high biomass gain (133.63 g for seedlings and 62.20 g for suckers). The increase in biomass was brought indirectly by high chlorophyll content and directly by the greater number of leaves and larger leaflet area produced under low light. Although the NAR was high under the high light condition, the accumulated photosynthesis contributed by the large leaflet area accounted for the high biomass of palasan under the low light condition. On the effect of moisture regimes, watering the plant every two and four days gave higher biomass, taller height and bigger diameter increase, more leaflets, larger leaflet area and higher assimilation rates than those watered every six days. The soil MC in plants watered every two and four days was about 30-35%. The anatomical parameter, i.e., stomatal behavior, showed that there were more closed stomates than open and half open in all light intensities at midday. The closing of stomates is a response to reduce transpiration. The analysis for starch and sugar contents indicated significant differences when exposed to different light intensities and watering regimes. The accumulation of proline, however, may imply that the test plants might be suffering from water stress. The results suggested that palasan at the late seedling and sucker state requires low light intensity and optimum soil moisture, provided by two to four days watering interval, for higher biomass production. The practical application of the results to palasan plantation establishment was discussed.

The growth of  palosapis (Anisoptera thurifera) were compared in pure stand after the liberation cutting of Acacia auriculiformis as nurse trees  and growth in mixed stand with A. auriculiformis. Results showed that height growth in pure stand was not significantly different from the mixed stand. However, diameter growth in pure stand was significantly higher than in mixed stand. During this particular growth stage, light intensity did not have a significant effect on the growth of A. thurifera in both mixed and pure stand. The rate of litter decomposition did not significantly differ in all treatments. The rate, however, was strongly affected by the amount of litter to be decomposed, moisture content of litter and soil which were affected by the amount of rainfall. The amount of litterfall in mixed stand was significantly higher than the amount of litterfall in either pure A. auriculiformis or pure A. thurifera stands. Litterfall was highly affected by the amount of rainfall, soil moisture and air temperature. Most of the nutrients in the soil decreased within one year of the study. However, organic matter and nitrogen increased in the upper soil layer (0-8 in) of the pure A. auriculiformis stand, in the lower horizon (8 - 16 in) of the mixed stand and in both soil depths  in grassland area. Phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) increased at the upper soil layer while magnesium (Mg) increased in both soil depths under the mixed stand. Calcium (Ca) increased at the upper soil layer in pure A. auriculiformis stand. Native mycorrhiza were found in the soil of all the treatments. Fungal and bacterial populations were sensitive to the amount of soil moisture.  Bacterial population was highest in the early part of dry season while fungal population was highest at the onset of rainy season. These responses were affected by the degree of soil aeration and temperature in dry and wet seasons. Nutrient partitioning differed in amount among biomass, soil and litter in the forest floor among the various plantation stands and the grassland. Nitrogen was highest in the soil of mixed stand, due to its high organic matter content and to N fixation by rhizobial population in symbiotic relation with A. auriculiformis. The macroelements P, K, Mg and Ca were highest in the biomass of pure A. auriculiformis due to the high nutrient uptake of this species. Litter had the lowest stored nutrients. Wood of A. auriculiformis in pure plantation had the highest stored nutrients followed by the branches, leaves and roots in that order. The bark of A. thurifera had the lowest nutrient content. Harvesting of stemwood only of A. auriculiformis under mixed stand would remove 22.2% N, 60% P, 19.7% K, 38.6% Mg and 42.1% Ca of the total stored nutrients within the stand. Harvesting of stemwood only of A. auriculiformis under pure stand would remove 15.2%, N, 86.1% P, 26.3% K, 40% Mg and 81.3% Ca of the total stored nutrients within the stand.

The study was conducted in the riverflood plains of Ilagan, Isabela from October 1996 to October 1997. Effects of cropping systems (corn-corn, soybean-corn and corn soybean intercrop-corn cropping systems), fertilizer sources (unfertilized, poultry manure and recommended synthetic fertilizer source) and insect control methods (untreated, Helicoverpa armigera, nuclear polyhedrosis virus and recommended insect control methods) on arthropod populations, including herbivores natural enemies and soil arthropods, and crop productivity and profitability were compared. The influence of climate, soil quality and alternate hosts/habitat to arthropods\' density were assessed. The abundant herbivores of corn were Atherigona oryza Malloch, Ostrinia furnacalis Guenee, Spodoptera spp. and Aphis craccivora Koch while soybeans were Empoasca sp., Cerotoma sp., Nezara viridula L, Spodoptera spp. and Homona coffearea. H. armigera was not considered a serious pest because of its low populations. The availability of alternate hosts contributed only a little to its population increase. The important natural enemies of corn and soybean herbivores were Menochilus sexmaculatus Fab. and Cyclosa insulana Copta, and araneid spider. The alternate habitats significantly increased the natural enemy populations. Twenty-one species of soil arthropods were extracted from soybean and cornfields. The most dominant was the detritivorous family Scheloribatidae consisting of three species. The wet season had relatively higher populations of arthropods than the dry season. Relative humidity (40-77%) and wind velocity (0.70-2.70 km/hour) were favorable to the populations of herbivores in the different cropping systems. The prolonged dry spell caused by uneven distribution of rainfall (2-132 mm/week) and air temperature (18.27?C) had negative effects. The recommended insect control practices for soybean and corn, which were chemical-based, decreased arthropod richness and densities. This was translated into yield advantage over untreated and HaNPV applied corn but not soybeans. However, such practices also reduced the densities of beneficial arthropods (natural enemies and soil arthropods) over the other treatments, which indicated the extent of disruption it caused to the agroecosystem stability especially in the long run. The synthetically fertilized plants had more abundant herbivores and natural enemies than the other fertilizer sources. However, this led to reduced richness of arthropods in general. Likewise, the soil applied with synthetic fertilizer was less favorable to the abundance of soil arthropods than poultry manure and unfertilized soils. The synthetically fertilized plants had higher yields in corn over the other fertilizer treatments, but not in soybeans. Corn soybean intercrop had higher species diversity (richness) of herbivores than the soybean and corn monocrop but not the species richness of other arthropods. In terms of abundance, soybean-corn and corn soybean intercrop-corn cropping systems had higher populations densities of arthropods than corn-corn cropping. The richness was associated with the species richness of crops. Soybean and corn had specialist herbivores, which contributed to the richness of the arthropods in soybean intercrop over the soybean and corn monocrop. Planting soybean, either as monocrop or intercrop without added fertilization and pesticide usage, therefore, was a more self-sustaining pest management strategy. This was because the cropping systems themselves enhanced natural enemy populations, which in turn would regulate herbivores. The soils in these cropping systems applied with the above management practices were conducive to soil arthropods that hasten decomposition of dead organic matter, which contributed to soil fertility and soil health. The contributions to soil fertility increased crop productivity and profitability.',NULL,NULL,'Pascual, Pet Roey L.','Agriculture, pechay, Brassica pekinensis, radish, Raphanus sativus, fermented activators, composting, fertilizer application',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2018-10-08-04_ab_55740.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(3065,'2021-09-01 07:44:54','2021-09-01 07:44:54','Pedological characterization of soils associated with Kennon limestone.','2021-09-01','The morphological, physical, chemical and mineralogical properties of soils in four land surface units along the Kennon limestone formation indicated strong correspondence between landscape positions and soil properties.

The soils formed in the fall face of La Trinidad and Green Valley had two different genetic pathways. In La Trinidad, the soil showed distinct umbric epipedon with cambic subsurface diagnostic horizon; hence, it was classified as Typic Dystropepts. In Green Valley, the presence of limestone outcrops, which somehow stabilized the landscape unit, favored the development of mollic epipedon and argillic subsurface layer. The soils were therefore grouped as Typic Argiudolls. The soil properties of the transportational midslope in La Trinidad were almost identical with those of Green Valley. In both sites, the soil profiles were deep and well developed. Both soils, identified as Typic Hapludalfs, had umbric epipedons and subsurface argillic horizons. The soil in the colluvial footslope of the La Trinidad was more developed than the soil in Green Valley. The soil in the former had a deep and well-developed profile. The surface soil was mollic epipedon and the subsurface horizon was argillic. The soil was Typic Argiudolls. The soil in the latter had ochric epipedon and cambic horizon in the surface and subsurface layers, respectively. Thus, the soil was classified as Fluventic Dystropepts.',NULL,NULL,'de Castro, Ronilo O.','broilers$xanimal feeding, aflatoxin, toxin binder, herbal liver conditioner',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2018-10-11-05_ab_55641.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(3066,'2021-09-01 07:44:54','2021-09-01 07:44:54','Tracking values systems in individual and organizational levels through the Values Orientation Workshop: an assessment.','2021-09-01','This was the first attempt to come up with an initial assessment of the Values Orientation Workshop (VOW) since it was introduced in the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources Research and Development (PCARRD) in 1992. The Civil Service Commission (CSC) initiated the conduct of VOW in all government agencies as sanctioned in Republic Act 6713. The law became the CSC\'s basis in developing new parameters and methodologies to measure the extent of VOW\'s effects on work attitudes and performance of individuals and their work relation in the organization. This study focused on the effects of the values enhancement program to the participants. It also helped identify significant and acquired values of individuals and eventually determined the effects of values intervention to work performance and their benefits to the organization. Since human values are never outmoded, the study further concluded that values systems still influenced government workers. Relatedly, once a supportive environment was provided by the management, the seeds of values were nourished in the human heart. Therefore, this became an opportunity for the management to develop its manpower/workforce - the core of the organization. Although values were unquantifiable, changes were manifested during the post-VOW. Responses were taken through questionnaires and interviews and later validated with superiors and peers. Commonalities in the effected changes were found in punctuality, wise use of resources, quicker delivery of service and some acts of simple living. Tangible tools were used as measuring instruments to validate the veracity of the findings: the performance rating for particular periods, participation in meetings and time cards a year before and after the VOW. The results of the validation were indicative of the objectives attained in the study. Finally, for the PCARRD leadership to sustain the changes manifested by the VOW graduates, motivational factors, supportive environment and other workable management interventions are needed. The results of the assessment may seve as reference/guide for PCARRD in fine-tuning existing policies and crafting new human resources development (HRD) guidelines and strategies to review the incentives and awards system, staff promotion and other nonmonetary incentives.',NULL,NULL,'Penaflor, Lerjun M.','Engineering, rice analog, rice, Oryza sativa, adlay, Coix lacryma-jobi',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2018-12-04-03_ab_55807.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(3067,'2021-09-01 07:44:54','2021-09-01 07:44:54','Methodology and format for monitoring biological impacts of quarrying in Teresa, Rizal, Philippines.','2021-09-01','The main objective of the study was to develop methodology and format for monitoring biological impacts of quarry projects.The methodology for monitoring biological impacts of quarrying, developed by the study specifically for Teresa, Rizal, Philippines, involved triangulation approach: flora and fauna from existing literature; verification of the baseline floral and faunal studies; and validation through the ethno biological surveys. The approach was used in monitoring changes in biodiversity indices before and after three years of limestone quarrying and in disturbed and undisturbed quarry areas. There was a marked increase in floral species richness after three years of quarry expansion activities brought about by the increase in the number of invasive, mostly introduced shrubs, weeds and grasses. Destruction of habitat for forest tree species adapted to limestone areas could also mean habitat improvement for other lesser desirable species. The floral species density was significantly reduced after three years of continuous limestone quarrying, indicating the devastating effect of quarrying on the density of certain species. The floral and faunal species evenness and species diversity index before and after quarrying and in the disturbed and undisturbed quarry areas did not differ significantly. Both plant communities assessed at different time frames and environmental conditions showed the pattern of few abundant species associated with many rare ones. No specific avifaunal species provided extremely high number of individuals. The format to facilitate monitoring biological impacts of quarrying included a checklist reflecting the species under investigations, presence or absence in existing literature, baseline data, verified data, and ethno biological surveys. Information on the species\' conservation status was also considered. Using the format, the biological impacts of quarrying were also determined as manifested in the extirpation of an indigenuous forest tree species, \'himamao\' (Dysoxyllum mollissimum: Meliaceae), a resident bat species, common bent-winged bat (Miniopterus schreibersii: Vespertilionidae) and a migrant bird, Asiatic migratory quail (Coturnix japonica: Phasianidae).',NULL,NULL,'Roxas, Mercedes L.','Agriculture, banana, plant resistance, Musa x paradisiaca L., black sigatoka, Mycosphaerella fijiensis Morelet',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2018-12-04-07_ab_55846.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(3068,'2021-09-01 07:44:54','2021-09-01 07:44:54','Participation of women in upland development: the case of the upland women in Sta.

Findings revealed that the respondent were mostly members of Kapitbisig, an ISFP formal organization in the study site, and were mainly housekeepers/farmers. They were relatively new residents comprising predominantly the economically active ages of 21-60 years old, characterized with low education and economic status. In terms of participation in farm activities, the respondents made farm decisions jointly with their husbands. However, their husbands did most of the strenuous activities in land/farm preparation, farm establishment and management, harvesting and postharvesting, livestock raising and management and charcoal making/fuelwood gathering. In community activities such as community meetings and skills development programs, the respondents had a relatively low participation. However, they were more involved in income-generating activities. Chi-square tests revealed the following significant relationship at 5% level of significance: (1) participation in farm decision making with educational attainment, exposure to reading materials and attendance in trainings and extension programs; (2) participation in community activities with attendance in trainings and extension programs and contact with change agents; and (3) participation in income-generating activities with annual family income and contact with change agents.

Secondary data were utilized to analyze quantitatively the past trend of grain production, consumption and the impact of the government\'s price support program. Nerlove\'s formulation of measuring welfare impacts of government programs was adopted in the study. The findings indicated that grain production declined because of the decrease in area devoted to grains while consumption increased steadily. The continuous decline in production, while consumption continued to increase resulted in large importation of grains to meet the domestic demand. In addition, the study found out that although nominal prices of grains increased, the real prices of grains decreased, which could have caused the decrease in the area devoted to grains. There was wider fluctuations in farm prices compared to wholesale and retail prices of grains. Wide fluctuation in farm prices was explained by the limited volume of grains transacted by NFA, which was the result of its limited budget and the weaknesses of its procurement and disbursement schemes. Likewise, this failure was influenced by the decline in grain production that resulted in the country\'s continuous importation of rice and corn. Furthermore, the buffer stock operation of the government failed to meet its target of a 90-day buffer stock level by July 1 each year. The producers and consumers gained in the implementation of price support and release price on grains. However, the program resulted in huge losses on the society, as a whole which meant that the net welfare effect of the program was negative or not beneficial at all.',NULL,NULL,'Carillo, Richard T.','rice, aromatic rice, plant breeding$zirrigated lowland, grain variability',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00','https://elibrary.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/slimsadmin/upload/2019-01-15-04_ab_55658.pdf','pdf_link',0,0),(3070,'2021-09-01 07:44:54','2021-09-01 07:44:54','Growth, pod yield and chemical composition of confectionery peanut (Arachis hypogfea L.) varieties as influenced by ferttilizer and molybdenum application.','2021-09-01','This study determined the influence of fertilizer, inoculation and molybdenum application on the growth, pod yield and chemical composition of confectionery peanut varieties.

The experiment was laid out in a 3 x 4 x 3 factorial in randomized complete block design (RCBD). Irrespective fo NPK, inoculation and Mo application, ICGV 88392 produced the highest pod yield (3.86 t/ha) which was 14.20%  higher than the control variety, BPI Pn-9, at 3.38 t. ICGV 88392 was also better than the two varieties in terms of nodule count, pod yield per plant, weight of 100 seeds, crude fat and potassium content of the seeds. The highest percentage increase on pod yield per hectare was noted from inoculated peanuts with 9.88% and 21.31% increase on nitrogen uptake with the application of 30-30-30 kg NPK/ha as compared to the unfertilized plants. Results also showed that foliar application of 1 and 3 ppm Mo significantly increased the pod yield per plant, pod yield per hectare, pod number per plant, weight of 100 seeds, seed\'s fat, phosphorus and potassium content and nitrogen uptake as compared to 0 ppm Mo. Inoculated ICGV 88392 applied with 1 ppm Mo produced the highest pod yield (4.68 t/ha) among the different treatment combinations. The seeds produced from the inoculated ICGV 88392 and sprayed with 3 ppm Mo had the highest potassium content. Correlation analysis showed that pod yield was positively related to days to maturity (r = 0.58**), 100-seed weight (r = 0.62**), seed fat (r = 0.61**) and nitrogen removal (r = 0.33**). Pod number was linearly but negatively correlated to 100-seed weight (r =  -0.70**).

The pathogenicity tests confirmed that Colletotrichum phomoides (Sacc.) Chester collected from Laguna and C. capsici (Sydow) Butler and Bisby from Benguet caused anthracnose disease in sweet pepper. High relative humidity levels, moderately high temperature and wide range of pH favored development of anthracnose. C. capsici developed rapidly at a high temperature range of 27?-35?C and wider RH levels of 95-100% compared with C. phomoides which developed well at 27?-30?C and a relative humidity from 90% to 100%. There was no difference in fungal growth at the different pH levels tested (pH 4-9). Chitosan at 1-4% effectively controlled the two Colletotrichum spp. It was effective against both pathogens whether applied before or after inoculation. The inhibitory effect of chitosan on the pathogens was not immediate unlike Prochloraz with either pathogen, which completely inhibited spore germination and mycelial growth of both fungi. Chitosan reduced spore germination and inhibited subsequent mycelial growth of the conidia that were able to germinate. Wall thinning and lysis of hyphal branches were observed in chitosan-treated spores. The epidermal and parenchyma cells of chitosan-coated tissues inoculated with either Colletotrichum sp. remained intact. No fungal fruiting bodies were observed in cross-sections of chitosan-treated tissues. This showed the fungistatic property of chitosan which was comparable in action with the Prochloraz fungicide.

Information on the biophysical, social and political conditions, management capabilities and practices were gathered through actual survey and interview. Each of these were analyzed and described. Soil physical and chemical properties varied. Some of which were statistically different while others were not. Most soils had a pH of more than seven while others were near seven. CEC, OM, P, K and Mn of most of the soils were low to very low. Widths of the street corridors and sizes of basins were below the standard. Aboveground utilities with plantings underneath were prevalent. Sizes of the parks were relatively small. Climatic conditions were relatively harsher and drier while pollution levels were already high. The public was highly aware of the importance of greening and of the usefulness and disadvantages of urban trees. Only few had actually participated in the greening but majority were willing to participate if given opportunity. Political atmosphere was only fairly supportive of the greening and other environmental issues and concerns though some of them had initiated greening activities. Legislation of greening ordinances was not given much attention. Greening offices in the cities and municipalities were already installed. Some were permanent while others were still quasi in nature. Some were well equipped in terms of manpower, financial and technological resources while others still needed to build up their capabilities. Each of the cities and municipalities had their own greening goal and objectives and had developed their own cultural management strategies although the practices needed some improvements. As to the conditions or status of street green spaces, Marikina had the highest  percent tree survival and percent tree health while Manila had the most number of species.  Differences in survival, health condition and species composition were statistically significant.

Specifically the study sought to accomplish the following: 1) describe the communication strategies in promoting agricultural technologies through the FSB Magsasaka Siyensista (MS) in Majayjay, Laguna; 2) find out, using the Steps to Behavior Change (SBC) framework, at what stage of behavior change the FSB-participant farmers were at the time of the study and 3) identify the factors that influenced the stage of behavior change the FSB-participant farmers were in at the time of the study. This study was a two-part exploratory research, consisting of in-depth key-informant interviews and a survey of the FSB-participant farmers.  Interviews and surveys were conducted using the structured guide questionnaires. Key-informants included the MS in Majayjay and officers from the provincial, regional and national FSBs. Data were analyzed using averages, percentages, frequency tables and comparative matrices. Findings showed that the MS used the seminar on lanzones production to promote the technologies. Only one seminar was conducted during the study period but the MS attended several cross-visits and visited demonstration farms. The participant-farmers, on the other hand, were not aware of the FSB program. The MS used lecture and discussion techniques, with sharing of experiences among the farmers, during the seminar, thereby using information and education approaches of communication. He also resorted to interpersonal, face-to-face forms of communication especially during the sharing of experiences. The farmers found the seminar highly interesting. The farmers rated highly the perceived degree of clarity, completeness and understandability of the messages presented about the technologies during the seminar. The messages highly aroused their interest and participants perceived the MS as being highly credible. Farmers\' other sources of information regarding the technologies included other lanzones farmers, the older people, friends, neighbors, community folk and relatives (e.g. grandfathers, fathers, husbands). The respondents reached the advocacy stage regarding use of the technologies, except for three farmers - two shifted to another farming activity and one had no intention of using the technologies because he was not yet into farming. It was found that a farmer may not necessarily pass through all the steps or stages of the SBC framework to proceed to another step of behavior. But one should have at least the knowledge of the technology before s/he could proceed to another step or stage. The farmers were highly knowlegeable of the technologies. They recalled an average of four out of the six technologies. They got high scores in defining and describing the technologies. Other factors affecting knowledge of the farmers about the technologies were their ability to recall and their exposure to the technology. The approval, intention and practice stages were influenced by the farmer\'s information/experiences about the technology, potential benefits of the technologies, applicability of technology to their farming activity, availability of resources for used of the technology and source credibility. The advocacy stage was influenced by the farmer\'s experiences about the technologies, potential benefits of the technologies, applicability to farming  activities and the farmer\'s desire to support the promotion activity. Farmers advocated the use of technologies through informal gatherings (e.g. in the field together with other farmers), meetings, informal story-telling time.

It was found that indigenous fodder trees have been utilized in smallholder livestock raising since the settlement of these hillylands in the late 1800s. Thus, farmers developed an intimate knowledge of fodder trees in terms of species identification, utilization, seasonal availability, preference ranking, cutting management, awareness of presence of anti-nutritive factors and screening other potential fodders. The PRA methodology was useful in encouraging farmers to share their indigenous knowledge systems, attitudes and values regarding fodder and livestock raising. The sociocultural and economic assessment showed that farmers collected and fed ruminant animals with highly preferred indigenous fodder tree species, namely: Macaranga tanarius or \"binunga\", Streblus asper  or \"kalios\" and Trema orientalis or \"anabiong\". The biophysical evaluation assessed these most highly preferred indigenous fodder tree species in terms of herbage production under two cutting management schemes (i.e., farmers\' cutting management versus an alternative quarterly cutting management), persistence, fodder quality, litterfall production and influence on some soil physicochemical properties. Total herbage yields for the whole year were significantly higher (a = .01) under the alternative cutting management than the farmers\' cutting management. However, more fodder during the dry months was available under the farmers\' cutting management. T. orientalis produced the highest amounts (a = .01) of total herbage, total dry matter and edible fraction yields regardless of cutting management. However, it suffered the greatest tree mortality when subjected to frequent cuttings of every three months. T. orientalis had the highest  fodder quality with significantly highest (a = .01) crude protein (173 g/kg DM) and high dry matter digestibility (52.8%) and low silica (68 g/kg DM) despite relatively higher lignin (104 g/kg DM) than S. Asper ad M. tanarius. Except for sodium, the macromineral composition of the selected indigenous fodder trees were quite high but were still below toxic levels for cattle. Sodium content of S. asper barely met animal requirements while M. tanarius and T. orientalis did not meet animal requirements at all. At the farmers\' feeding  level of 2-3 kg DM herbage/animal per day, salt supplementation should be recommended to farmers. Condensed tannin contents differed with species and with leaf maturity. Total litterfall production was not significantly different among the selected indigenous fodder trees but was not  significantly inlfuenced by cutting management. Farmers\' less frequent harvests resulted in more litterfall than the alternative quarterly fodder harvest. In terms of litterfall quality, S. asper contained comparably high N (1.60%), moderate P (0.08%) and K (0.82%), lowest C:N ratio (17.8) and lower lignin (9.38%). Significantly highest (a = .05) values of total N (0.07%), avail P (74.43%), organic C (2.40%) and OM (4.13%) were observed in the soils around T. orientalis than those associated with M. tanarius or S. asper. In terms of the quantity and quality of fodder biomass produced per tree, T. orientalis was the most promising among the three species studies. On the other hand, S. asper had the greatest potential of adding nutrients back to the soil through litterfall quality. Indigenous fodder trees played an important role in bridging the gap in fodder supply during the critical five-to seven-dry months per year in the area. When other feed resources were used up, indigenous fodder trees provided the crucial resource that ensures at least the survival of ruminant livestock in smallholder farms.

For ripening and postharvest investigations, fruits at color break were harvested and ripened at 25?C. High respiration rate, increased hexose and ascorbic acid levels, elevated invertase activities, and actively dividing parenchyma cells were associated with early fruit growth period. Rapid increase in fruit size, high glucose content and decreasing invertase activities accompanied subsequent cell enlargement. Maturation phase was characterized by sucrose accumulation, low levels of ascorbate and invertase activities, maximum fruit size and firmness, and change in seed color. Onset of ripening was marked by respiratory climacteric minimum, start of ethylene and ACC production due to increased activities of ACC synthase and ACC oxidase, peel and pulp color change and sharp decrease in tissue firmness. Ripening fruit exhibited climacteric peak, autocatalytic ethylene production, maximum invertase activities, increased fructose and ascorbic acid levels, loss of latex, appearance of intercellular spaces and development of full yellow pulp and peel. Likewise, all enzyme activities and related substrates declined, internal ethylene and oxygen decreased, postclimacteric declined and the pulp of the cell wall disintegrated. Throughout fruit development and ripening period, sucrose-related enzymes such as sucrose synthase and sucrose phosphate synthase had relatively low activities; and starch contents remained less than one percent. This characteristic indicated that papaya fruits had to be harvested at color break for optimum eating and handling  quality. This was the first report on the occurrence of sorbitol in tropical fruit, such as papaya.

Climatic factors such as high temperature, high light intensity and high rainfall or moisture during ontogeny predisposed the fruits to develop IB when subjected to heat treatments. The ratio of (Mg + Ca) to K, which differed between the two locations was a critical  factor and correlated well with the susceptibility of the fruit to develop IB.

However, shelf life was extended by three days relative to the untreated fruits which showed disease symptoms on the 5th day of storage. Weight loss, soluble solids, total sugars and alpha-amylase activity were significantly higher in heat-treated fruits than the untreated fruits during Season I. On the other hand, titratable acidity (TA) was significantly higher in fruits from Location 2 harvested during the wet season than the fruits in Location I harvested during the dry season.

Analysis showed that fresh cassava foliage contained hydrocyanic acid (HCN) ranging from 86 ppm to 186 ppm (fresh basis). Processing by wilting or drying reduced (P<0.01) HCN content below 80 ppm (dry basis) for low and medium HCN varieties but not for high HCN variety which was reduced only by ensiling. Silage pH (3.5 - 4.5) and physical appearances indicated that cassava foliage was good as silage. Feeding value evaluation showed its potential as ruminant feed i.e., 16.6 - 22.6% crude protein, 1.71 - 1.83% calcium, 62 - 67% total digestible nutrients and 2.15 - 2.21% voluntary dry matter feed intake. However, phosphorus content was low at 0.25 - 0.30%. In situ digestibility evaluation showed that total dry matter and protein disappearance were lower (P<0.01) in dried compared to ensiled CSF. On the contrary, in vivo digestibility of protein was higher in dried than in ensiled CSF. This indicated that drying the cassava foliage provided physical protection from bacterial attack which caused the material to bypass rumen degradation, thus, digestion took place in the lower digestive tract. Buffaloes fed with different levels of cassava foliage showed that average daily gain (ADG) increased (P<0.01) from 0.74 kg in control (0% CSF) to 0.86 kg with 50% CSF in roughage. Feeding CSF at 75% of roughage did not improve animal performance. Dry matter intake was highest at 25% CSF feeding with 2.36% of body weight. This reduced to 2.28% at 50% CSF and 2.14% at 75% CSF. Feed intake reduction at high CSF silage feeding could be attributed to increased HCN ingestion. Sulfur supplementation (2 g/kg CSF) as aid in thiocyanate formation during HCN detoxification process increased (P<0.05) dry matter intake of animals fed 75% CSF but not for those fed 50% CSF. However, sulfur did not increase liveweight gain with ADG of 0.9 - 0.94 kg at 50% CSF feeding and 1.01 - 1.02 kg at 75% CSF feeding. Increased intake at 75% CSF feeding indicated that sulfur was used in the detoxification process. On the other hand, decreased feed intake at 50% CSF feeding indicated that HCN intake was minimal and sulfur derived from sulfur containing amino acid in the diet was sufficient to detoxify the level of HCN. Income analysis in CSF-based feeding showed that at 0% CSF, net income over feed cost was P18.22/kg weight gain. This increased to P20.41/kg for 25% CSF, P20.99/kg for 50% CSF and P22.19/kg weight gain for 75% CSF. Comparative income analysis of different cassava-based production system showed that an increase from P15,360 in cassava without defoliation to P22,160 in cassava with defoliation, five months after planting and P36,775 for cassava with livestock integration.

These were farmer-respondents in three regions (Regions I, II  and  III) of Luzon covering four provinces, namely, Ilocos Sur, Isabela, Cagayan and Nueva Ecija. Data were gathered from October to December 1994 through structured survey questionnaire and field visitation.  The study also utilized secondary data such as annual reports, published reports, statistical data and other information related to the study. Data were analyzed using frequency counts, percentages and mean. The Statistical Analysis System (SAS) with PROC NPAR1WAY procedure was used to analyze the data in ordinal, interval and ratio levels of measurement. Path analysis was used as the main analytical method in assessing the interrelationships among variables and their contributions to the dependent variables under study. Findings showed that the organization-related variables such as leadership, resources, linkages and organizational structure/arrangements and beneficiary-related factors such as educational attainment, tenurial status, cropping pattern, resources, membership in organized farmers\' organizations and perception were characterized with varying features among the provinces under study. Likewise, differences in participation planning/decision-making, contact with change agents, participation in program-related activities, technology promotion, and credit assistance were observed between and among the program sites. Results of the path analysis showed that yield was significantly influenced by capital in monetary terms, land, monitoring and evaluation while income was highly influenced by capital, land area, market assistance and cost of inputs. Significant determinants of access to social services were educational attainment, market characteristics, technology promotion and credit. Additional capital borowed, household size, monitoring and evaluation, and capital significantly influenced enterpreneural capability.  Length of years as cooperator was the primary factor that influenced ownership of land, equipment and facilities.

The population of Fov was lowest in the potted soil planted to corn and highest in plots grown with weeds. Cotton and mungbean favored the increase or survival of Fov in the soil. The number of Fov was lower in the soil planted to CRDI-I compared with UPL-C2. The population of Fov in naturally infested soil was suppressed when corn was used as previous crop. Plots previously grown to peanut, mungbean and weeds such as Cenchrus echinatus, Eleusine indica, Euphorbia heterophylla, Ipomoea triloba, Amaranthus spinosus and Cyperus rotundus favored the survival of the pathogen. The number of Fov was signficantly reduced in the soil planted consecutively with corn. A. spinosus and C. rotundus favored the survival of the pathogen. The number of Fov was significantly reduced in the soil planted consecutively with corn. The results suggested that cotton variety did not exert a direct on the population of Fov and Trichoderma spp. in the soil. There was no discernible relationship between the population of Fov and Trichoderma spp. CRDI-I out yielded UPL-C2 when they were planted in Fusarium-infested area. The yield advantage of CRDI-I can be partially attributed to its ability to resist or tolerate fusarium wilt. Higher numbers of Fov was associated with standard inorganic fertilizer practices (SFP) and relatively lower number of Fov was associated with bio-organic fertilizer fortified with Trichoderma inocula. Plants treated with SFD gave the lowest incidence of fusarium wilt, plant mortality and highest seedcotton yield. The predetermined levels of disease of fusarium wilt at various crop stages exerted significant effect on the seedcotton yield of cotton varieties. For a variety resistant or tolerant to fusarium wilt like CRDI-I, as the infection increased yield loss increased. Losses were due to the high disease incidence at the seedling, bolling and flossing stages which can be best described by the following models: Y = 9.08 + 0.868 X1, Y = 11.40 + 0.737 X4  and Y = -2.65 + 1.052 X5, where Y is percent seedcotton yield loss and  X1, X4 and X5 are disease incidence at seedling, bolling and flossing stages, respectively. For a nontolerant variety such as UPL-C2, the relationship was best described by Y  = 7.19 + 0.871 X1 and  Y = 10.00 + 1.072 X3,  where X1 and X3  are the incidence at seedling and flowering stages, respectively. The single- and multiple-point models, which were derived using least square regression techniques were useful in the satisfactory estimation of seedcotton yield from disease incidence.

The test showed that yemane was more resistant to drought than K. bangkal. Yemane did not show any leaf shedding up to 25% MC, whereas K. bangkal exhibited leaf senescene followed by leaf abscisson at higher soil moisture stresses.

Occasionally, chico, cashew and calamansi supported larval developmental but these were considered as minor hosts of the insect. Fruit infestation was relatively high and exceeded 50% in guava, mango and sineguelas; 16-42% in avocado, jackfruit, papaya and santol; and less than 2% in cashew, chico and citrus. Fruits were susceptible to fly attack as they ripened and more larvae were recovered from fallen than picked ripe fruits. Infestation was primarily by D. dorsalis Hendel. However, D. umbrosus Fabricius and D. cucubitae Coquillett were also recovered from some fruit samples. The maximum number of flies caught was recorded in June with 12.24 catch per trap per day (cptd) while the minimum was in February with 0.08 cptd. There was adult fly population build up in mid-March, with the highest peak in June. Population sharply decreased in July then fluctuated in the succeeding months and eventually declined towards November and December. Several factors were observed to affect fly population in the field. Among these were food, rainfall, temperature, parasites and fly movement. The availability of food, however, stood out as the most limiting factor in fly abundance. Insecticides applied as conventional spray (nonbait) were effective only in reducing fruit fly infestation if sprayed at 75, 90 and 105 days after flower inducation.

This field experiment was conducted to quantify the effects of the level and timing of deficit irrigation on the increase of plant height, dry matter production, yield and yield components and water-use efficiency (WUE) of soybean plants; to know how the length of the growing season of soybean plants was affected by deficit irrigation; to determine which of the yield components was responsible for the increase/decrease in grain yield; and to determine the economic feasibility of practicing deficit irrigation for soybean production in Northern Samar. Two croppings were conducted starting April 1, 1997 (first cropping) and April 15, 1997 (second cropping) in the experimental area of the University of Eastern Philippines (UEP), Catarman, Northern Samar. The soybean plants were planted on split plots laid out in a randomized complete block design (RCBC) with three replications. The factors considered were the level (D) and timing (T) of deficit irrigation. The level treatments (DO or FI, D20, D40) were assigned as the subplots while the timing treatments (T1, T2, T3) were the mainplots. Results showed that as the level of deficit irrigation increased from 20% to 40%, significant reductions were observed in the average increase in plant height (24.2-32.6%), total vegetative dry matter production (25.7-34.8%), pod dry matter production (25.8-37.4%), total reproductive dry matter production (18.8-27.6%), number of pods per square meter (14.9-27.1%) and grain yield (18.7-30.3%). However, reductions were generally higher when water deficits were imposed during seed enlargement stage (17.4-36.7%) than when they were imposed during flowering stage (10.2-23.6%) or pod formation stage (7.7-15.2%). The number of seeds per pod and the 100-seed weight were reduced by deficit irrigation but such reductions were insignificant. The length of growing period of soybean plants under deficit irrigation was shorter by almost two days than that of the fully irrigated plants. However, no significant differences were observed between the length of growing period of the 20% and 40% water deficient plants. Plants under deficit irrigation during the flowering and pod formation stages also matured in about two days earlier than the fully irrigated plants. Deficit irrigation carried out during the seed enlargement stage failed to shorten the growing period of soybean plants. Deficit irrigation significantly improved the average WUE of soybean plants when this was accomplished during the flowering  (127-132%) and pod formation (130-133%) stages compared to the fully irrigated plants. Plants under 20% deficit irrigation had the highest average WUE while the fully irrigated plants had the lowest. The practice of deficit irrigation during the seed enlargement stage did not improve the WUE over that of full irrigation. The average potential net returns of soybean cropping under 20% and 40% deficit irrigation were, respectively, higher and lower than that of the full irrigation practice. Deficit irrigation reduced the potential net returns of soybean cropping during the seed enlargement stage. The highest potential net return of P61,093.65 was obtained in 20% deficit irrigation during pod formation stage. Of the different yield components, only the number of pods affected the grain yield of soybean plants, and consequently, the potential net returns.

The two isomers of endosulfan had very short periods of existence under the conditions of the experiment. Measurable half-life values for endosulfan I and endosulfan II were, respectively, 2.3 days and 3.8 days in suspended soil particles, and 1.3 days and 1.8 days in plants. The insecticides showed uneven distribution in the different components. The highest concentrations were found in fish and plants, followed by levels in suspended soil particles, and then in soil and paddy water. The effect on fish in the sprayed paddies was immediate and lethal. Evaluation of lindane transport and distribution among treated and untreated paddies revealed a predictably higher degree of mass flow in paddy water and suspended soil particles. Both lateral and vertical movements within the soil profile had small to negligible effects, these being highly influenced by the insecticide solubility in water. The effect of repeated insecticide application on the build up or accumulation of residue levels in the different components was not apparent. Results revealed the greater persistence of the a-isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane. Samples collected one month after harvesting showed its presence but none of lindane or endosulfan residues.

When accounted separately, PVX was the most prevalent followed by PVS, PLRV and PVY in descending order. Double infections, particularly the PVX and PVS combination were the most prevalent followed by the quadruple and triple infections. Yield losses effected in the certified \'Red Pontiac\' were higher than in the uncertified \'Conchita\'. Combined virus infections in \'Conchita\' effected more yield losses were more number of component viruses with the maximum loss in the quadruple infection. Slicing seedpieces increased PVX incidence in both certified and uncertified seedstocks. However, the practice had no significance in the combined infections in the uncertified seedstock. In yield losses slicing of seedpieces effected higher than in the wholepiece. Closer planting distances had no significance in virus incidence in the uncertified seedstock. However, yield losses were generally increased with closer distances. Similarly, the application of insecticides did not control PLRV and PVY in the uncertified seedstock but these two were controlled in the certified seedstock. When insecticide application was supplemented with roguing of plants with apparent virus symptoms, PLRV was eliminated while PVY was appreciably reduced. Generally, plants with roguing yielded more tubers than plants without roguing treatment.

The best mycelial growth was obtained in 25% rice bran decoction agar but malt extract (Blakeslee) produced the most number of fruiting bodies in submerged cultures. Addition of malt extract to the various decoctions also enhanced growth and fruiting. Although growth was fair in all culture vessels used, fruiting bodies were never produced in petri dishes. Fruiting occurred only in catsup or dextrose bottles and Erlenmeyer flasks, which apparently provided the aeration needed for the initiation and differentiation of the fruiting bodies. Growth in complete darkness, which was also equivalent to 0 foot candle, was the same with that of red light. White light of a shorter wavelength (400 nm) was more effective during the first weeks of fruiting but red light with a longer wavelength (640-720 nm) had a more pronounced effect toward the last weeks of fruiting. Two-minute exposure to UV irradiation twice daily also enhanced mycelial growth. The optimum temperature and pH for growth and fruiting was 30?C and pH 6.0, respectively. There was a slight lowering of pH observed during the peak of fruiting. Mechanical shaking favored production of more mycelium in pellet form, which made this mushroom a very good material for this purpose. Addition of the sugars sucrose, glucose, dextrose significantly enhanced mycelial growth but decreased largely the production of fruit body primordia. Among the nitrogen sources tried, only ammonium nitrate at 0.0001% induced slight mycelial growth in this organism. On the other hand, urea at 0.001% and 0.01% considerably favored fruiting.

In Experiment 1.1, the freeze-dried Stylo leaves had the highest dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) contents. Both freeze-dried and sun-dried leaves + stem had the highest neutral detergent fiber (NDF), while freeze-dried leaves + stem had the highest acid detergent fiber (ADF) and cellulose values. Lignin content was highest in freeze-dried and sun-dried leaves + stem. Freeze-dried leaves + stem had the highest N solubility. Sun drying increased the acid detergent insoluble nitrogen (ADIN) of Stylo leaves and leaves + stem. Sun-dried leaves had the highest in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) after 48 hours of rumen incubation. After 72 hours of rumen incubation, both freeze-dried and sun-dried leaves had the highest IVDMD values. Experiment 1.2 showed that increasing levels of Stylo supplementation improved the CP and decreased the cell wall components of rice straw-based rations. The ADIN value was further increased by the inclusion of 20% Flemingia with or without polyethelene glycol (PEG). The N solubility, IVDMD, and in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) values were increased by high level of Stylo supplementation, lowered by the inclusion of 20% Flemingia and improved by the addition of PEG. In sacco evaluation (Experiment 2) revealed no significant differences in percent DM and rate of DM disappearance among treatment rations, while percent CP rate of CP dissapearance were significantly lowered by the inclusion of 10% Flemingia with or without PEG. In vivo experiment (Experiment 3) indicated that 40% Stylo supplementation significantly improved CP digestibility of the ration. In Experiment 4, the evaluation of production responses using 18 growing male sheep showed that sheep in TI ration had significantly higher total dry matter intake (DMI) (402.54 g/day) and liveweight change (1.79 kg) than those sheep fed rations T2 (385.85 g/day and 1.07 kg) and T3 (388 g/day and 1.22 kg). Supplementation of mixture of Stylo + Flemingia (T3) resulted in average daily gain (ADG) and feed efficiency (FE) similar to that of concentrate supplementation (T1) indicating improvement in N utilization as shown in the insignificant differences in crude protein intake (CPI), N balance and N utilization among treatments. Supplementations of Stylo alone and the mixture of Stylo + Flemingia lowered the total feed cost and feed costs per kilogram gain per day.

A split-plot design in randomized complete blocks replicated three times was used in the experiment. The two main plot treatments were three-year fallow kakawate-based alley cropping system and the control (open areas without hedgerows). The subplot treatments were the corn (CO), mungbean (MB) and sweet potato (SP) crops and the control (unplanted) (NC). The results showed that soil physico-chemical properties of a three-year fallow kakawate-based alley cropping system were better than those in the control (without hedgerows). Soil water holding capacity (WHC), pH, OM, P, K, and cation exchange capacity (CEC) declined in all treatments after cropping. The decline in soil chemical properties was significant for all variables except for P and CEC in the subsoil. Surface runoff (SRO) and sediment yield of a three-year fallow kakawate-based alley cropping system were significantly lower (119.407 cu m/ha per year and 12.135 t/ha per year, respectively) than in areas without hedgerows (237.385 cu m/ha per year and 45.547 t/ha per year, respectively). In terms of crops tested, sweet potato had lower SRO (162.48 cu m/ha per year and sediment yield (26.397 t/ha per year) followed in descending order by corn (170.01 cu m/ha per year and 27.095 t/ha per year), mungbean (178.71 cu m/ha per year and 29.095 t/ha per year, and plots with no crops (202.38 cu m/ha per year and 32.778 t/ha per year), respectively. The three-year-old kakawate hedgerows unpruned for three years and planted in 10-meter intervals between hedgerows accumulated a total biomass of 36.312 t/hour. For its part, the total biomass production of the three-year-old kakawate hedgerows for four pruning operations was 7.8 t/ha per year for one year. The organic litter decomposition in the three-year-old kakawate hedgerows was 95.483% decomposed after 12 weeks. The growth and yield of corn, mungbean and sweet potato in a three-year fallow kakawate-based alley cropping system and in plots without hedgerows were not significantly affected by the treatments used in the study. However, crops planted in the alleys of three-year fallow kakawate hedgerows had relatively higher yield than in crops grown in plots without hedgerows. In terms of economic benefits, the harvested three year-old kakawate hedgerows can be utilized for post and fuelwood. The product obtained had a net present value of P128,911.80/ha. When the alleys were cropped with corn, mungbean and sweet potato for the same number of years, a net present value of P97,080.60/ha could be obtained. However, between alley crops like corn, mungbean and sweet potato planted in-between the alleys of newly harvested three-year fallow kakawate hedgerows, net present value was higher than when these crops were planted in areas without hedgerows (net present value of P79,825.61).',NULL,NULL,'Lanwang, Cherry V.','solid waste, compost, nitrogen mineralization',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(3094,'2021-09-01 07:44:54','2021-09-01 07:44:54','Status and behavior of phosphorus in some acid soils in the Philippines.','2021-09-01','Chemical electrochemical properties related to the fate or behavior of applied and native phosphorus (P) were studied in some acid soils such as Alaminos, Annam, Luisiana, and Prensa. Acidity measured by pH in water was in the order: Luisiana>Alaminos>Annam = Prensa. The pH in N KCl was one unit lower than in water and acidity was in the order: Luisiana>Prensa>>Alaminos>Annam. The pH in N K2SO4 was lower than in water but higher than in N KCl, and acidity was in the order: Luisiana>Alaminos>Prensa>Annam. The order of decreasing exchangeable aluminum content followed the order of decreasing pH in N K2SO4. Potentiometric titration curves for lime requirement showed similarity between Prensa and Annam. Cation exchange capacity (CEC) at pH 7.0 was higher than at pH 4.8 and the difference was greatest in Luisiana which had the lowest pH and highest lime requirement. Base saturation at pH 7.0 was lower than at pH 4.8 by 15-20% except for Annam which remained almost unchanged. Luisiana contained the highest P and Prensa had the least but only a small fraction of total P in the soil was extractable. The lowest percentage was in Luisiana which had high acidity, buffering capacity and free Fe2O3. Majority of the P was in iron (Fe)-phosphate fraction and aluminum (Al)- and Fe-phosphate made up 33-53% of the total P. The zero point of charge (ZPC) of the four soils was higher than their pH in water hence, these soils had net positive charge. Phosphorus sorption evaluated with the Langmuir adsorption isotherms were curvilinear. Diverse P sorption characteristics were exhibited. Nevertheless, the relationship was linear at lower P concentrations. Phosphorus sorption capacity of the soils was in the order: Alaminos>Prensa>Luisiana>Annam. Calculations of adsorption maxima (b) and bonding energy constant (K) were done by curve splitting. Index of sorption capacity for each soil increased but apparent affinity of P for the sorption sites decreased at higher concentration. Iron-P fraction was higher than Al-P and Ca-P fractions in both cases where lime was added before P and P was added before lime. Aluminum-P was not significantly changed by increasing lime level although it interacted with sampling time in Luisiana. Luisiana which was high in free Fe2O3 had low Fe-P fraction in the first week sampling but attained about seven- to ten-fold increase in the fourth week sampling. Calcium-P increased at higher lime rate in Luisiana. Phosphorus was fixed primarily as Al-P in Alaminos, and as Fe-P in Annam, Luisiana and Prensa.

The log-linear production function was used to estimate the contribution of irrigation investments to total irrigated palay production. Irrigation investments were transformed from stock to flow variables assuming constant annual service flows with 50 years life span. The discount rates used were 10, 15, 20, and  25%. The time lag specified which were It-3, It-4 and It-5, implied that benefits derived from irrigation investments in the form of increased yield came three to five years after the initiation of the project. The elasticities of irrigaton investments derived from the aggregate production functions ranged from 0.10 at It-5 to 0.26 at It-3. In the yield per hectare production functions, these elasticities ranged from 0.08 at It-5 to 0.12 at It-3. These elasticities were constant at varying rates of interest. However, a higher elasticity was observed at time lag It-3 than at other two time periods. The other variables defined in the production functions were agricultural labor, fertilizer consumption and operating capital. The insignificant coefficient of the agricultural labor variable reaffirmed the labor surplus situation in Philippine agriculture. The coefficients of fertilizer consumption were significant, hence, the importance of this input in irrigated palay production. Operating capital had a high multicollinearity with fertilizer consumption and agricultural labor, as shown on the negative coefficients and statistical insignificance. A dummy variable was included in all the equations to quantify the shift, if there was any, in the production function due to the introduction of modern technology in the late 60s. There was a positive and significant shift in the intercept of the estimated production function. This implied that during the later half of the period, production efficiency increased due to introduction of modern production methods. The estimates of the marginal value productivities (MVP) indicated higher returns to every P1,000 irrigation investments. The MVP decreased at increasing rates of interest, but higher at It-3 than the other time period specified. Irrigation investment requirements based on the required irrigated hectarage to meet a specified level of national palay output were estimated. This was consistent with situations of self sufficiency, surplus of +10% and a deficit of -10%. These projections were based on the rice requirements using the \"low\", \"medium\" and \"high\" population projections. The results showed that the level of irrigated land area in 1985 sustained the projected rice requirements for the following decade and a half, given an increased cropping intensity and increased yield per hectare. As such, irrigation investments until 1985 was imperative. The magnitude of the incremental investments in irrigation from 1975 to 1985 were P281 M, P363 M and P500 M for the \"low\", \"medium\" and \"high\" population projections, respectively.

The model, designed for estimating structural parameters and policy analysis, linked the principal structural elements of markets for each commodity in the domestic and foreign markets. The study investigated the economic structure of the major factors that determine aggregate supply and demand relationships of these different wood products and to assess their relative importance. The Two-Stage Least-Squares (TSLS) was used to estimate the regression coefficients of the parameters in the model. TSLS estimates were statistically consistent and had the same asymptotic variance as the Limited-Information Single-Equation estimates. Logarithms were used in the study partly because of the  ease in inputting elasticity but especially because there was a priori reason that any time trend in forest products demand and supply was roughly exponential. The ECON documentation, was utilized in the formulation of the computer program. Except for a few minor demand and supply shifters, all the rest of the explanatory variables included in the final model played major roles in explaining supply-demand relationships. They were likewise highly significant. Through elasticity and price flexibility estimates the relative influence of individual explanatory variables were compared. Test results showed that the signs of the obtained regression coefficients corresponded to the a priori expectations and were consistent with the postulated economic behavior and theoretical expectations. Further, in all relations studied, the D-W test statistic indicated that neither positive nor negative serial correlation was a problem, nor did a plot of residuals over time for all equations reveal any serial correlation.

The Chapman-Richards model found the tree-site index as more reflective of the site quality properties. It was also more preferable because of easy data gathering and no laboratory analyses were needed. However, soil-site index could be used in areas where there were no standing trees. Based on 121 sample plots, the dominant height of Leucaena leucocephala was strongly correlated with elevation, depth of A-horizon, pH, phosphorus, rainfall, magnesium and nitrogen.

Specific gravity, cell wall thickness, and Runkel ratio (RR) exhibited an increase radially for all strains studied. For specific gravity, the apparent increase from 20% to 100% of the radial distance reckoned from the pith ranged from 34.52% for K28 to 52.16% for K8. For fiber length, the increase was from 13.39% for K67 to 19.85% for K8. On the other hand, cell wall increased in thickness from 7.08% for K67 to 9.52% for K22 from pith to the bark. RR values likewise increased from 13.16% for K67 to 21.21% for K28. The other properties examined such as extractive content, fiber diameter and lumen width showed general decrease toward the bark. The radial pattern of variation of the different wood properties exhibited by individual strains showed no serious departures from the patterns based on the pooled data for all strains. Since variety effect was highly significant for extractive content, fiber length, cell wall thickness and RR, the different strains were compared and ranked according to the magnitude of their means. The comparison showed that extractive content and fiber length of K28, K22 and K8 were not significantly different from each other. However, the extractive content of K28 was significantly different from K67 but those of K22 and K8 were not significantly different from K67. On the other hand, K67 had a fiber length, which was statistically different from the other strains. In terms of cell wall thickness and RR, K22 was not significantly different from K8 and K67 but significantly different from K28. However, K8 and K67 were not significantly different from K28 in both properties. The degree to which the different wood quality indicators were associated with each other was studied by partial correlation analysis. Specific gravity showed a strong positive correlation with extractive content, cell wall thickness, and RR. A strong negative correlation apparently existed between specific gravity and fiber diameter. The correlations between specific gravity with fiber length and diameter at breast height (DBH) were rather weak. Extractive content and lumen width were correlated in a strong positive manner. A weak positive correlation existed between extractive content and cell wall thickness, fiber length, DBH and RR. Cell wall thickness had a strong positive correlation with fiber diameter and RR. Lumen width, however, was negatively correlated with RR and DBH, although the correlations with the latter was rather weak.

Each field was provided with an artificially inoculated primary focus of 15 plant-hills at center of approximately 6,400 plant-hills. The disease progress pattern indicated a continuous increase during the wet and dry season. The disease progress curve generated by PStV was on S-shaped curve, which was typical of a polycyclic or a compound interest disease. According to Vanderplank\'s equation of average apparent infection rate for compound interest disease, higher rate of infection occurred during the dry season (r=0.36 per unit week-1) than during the wet season (r=0.27 per unit week-1). Likewise, higher levels of final disease incidence was observed during the dry season (6.58-8.30%) than during the wet season (2.28-4.50%). The higher level of aphid dispersal during the dry season possibly contributed to higher disease incidence and rate of infection. The spread of PStV in space showed a focal pattern indicating a localized spread of the disease from plant-to-plant by nonpersistent aphid vectors. Incidence of PStV decreased with increasing distance of annuli from primary focus. The disease gradient of PStV was steeper in the wet season (-1.65) than in the dry season (-1.29). An account of the estimated multiple linear relationship between disease incidence and environmental factors, indicated that temperature was the most important factor in the spread of PStV in both seasons. Sunshine duration and aphid count were significantly correlated to disease incidence only in the dry season while evaporation and rain were not significantly correlated in both seasons. Aphis craccivora was identified as the principal vector of PStV in the area. The yield and yield components of peanut were not significantly correlated with time of PStV infection.

Increment counts were used to compare growth rates among the three species. In as much as all fish were reared in captivity, the effects of some variables like mean length increment per day, mean length, mean water temperature, location of experimental set up, sea and pond, and different feeds on the growth of the three species in captivity were also determined. The ring increments on the otoliths occurred daily. Captive fish had lower growth rates than their wild counterparts. The variables in question did not explain the growth of the fish but rather, other uncontrolled ecological factors affected fish growth. This suggested that the experimental setup was not favorable for detailed examination on the effects of the variables on the growth of the experimental animals.',NULL,NULL,'Paglinawan, Luvie E.','Environmental science, flood risk$zLapad River, Sta.

The respondents, categorized into three groups, were consisted of 103 second year ATC students, 28 instructors and administrators and 40 prospective employers representing the five employer agencies. Data were gathered through questionnaires and interview schedule. The findings disclosed that only about one-fifth (21%) of the students wanted to engage in farming while almost four-fifths (79%) chose to seek wage employment after graduation. Of the latter group, 66% wished to be agricultural technicians and 13% wanted to be agricultural extension workers. The three socioeconomic factors which decisively influenced occupational choices were students\' land ownership, the land area owned by their parents and their perception of their parents\' occupational aspirations for them. The students had more favorable attitude toward farming than what they perceived was the attitude of the people in their home communities. Likewise, the students had more favorable attitude toward wage employment than what they perceived was the attitude of the community people. The difference, however, was not statistically significant. The students, instructors and administrators perceived that the basic courses and supervised farming program of the two-year agricultural technician curriculum prepared the students better for farming than wage employment. Statistically, however, the difference between the students\' perception and the instructors, and administrators\' perception of some aspects of the curriculum was not significant. Likewise, the differences between the perceived preparedness for farming and the perceived preparedness for wage employment (considering the basic courses and the supervised farming program of the curriculum among students, instructors and administrators) were statistically insignificant. The instructors and administrators indicated that the first possible activity of the ATC graduates was working in the government and private agencies, closely followed by going into farming. Trailing behind was for the graduates to continue and finish a degree course. On the other hand, the employer-respondents representing the five employer agencies revealed that the ATC graduates\' chances of being employed in their agencies were slim since they would prefer the B.S. in Agriculture graduates.',NULL,NULL,'Dinglasan, Eric G.','Agriculture, endogenous banana streak badnavirus, banana, plant pathology',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(3102,'2021-09-01 07:44:55','2021-09-01 07:44:55','Utilization of gmelina (Gmelina arborea Roxb.) leaves and fruits as feed for sheep (Ovis aries).','2021-09-01','Three studies were conducted to evaluate gmelina leaves, fruits, and their combinations as feed for sheep. In Study I, the chemical composition and in-vitro digestibility of gmelina were evaluated. Gmelina leaves and fruits, 1/2 kg each, was taken as sample and subjected to laboratory analysis. In-vitro digestibility of gmelina leaves, fruits and their combination was carried out in completely randomized design (CRD) using sheep rumen liquor. Results revealed that gmelina leaves had higher nutrient composition (80.58% dry matter (DM), 12.5% crude protein (CP), 0.45% Ca) than gmelina fruits (78.49% DM , 5.51% CP, 0.29% Ca). Gmelina fruits had higher phosphorus (0.34%) than its leaves (0.32%). Gmelina leaves had higher cell wall components than its fruits. Both gmelina leaves and fruits contained 1.76% and 1.62% tannic acid and 1.29% and 1.09% coumarin, respectively. The in-vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) of 78.94% and in-vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) of 86.39% were higher (P< 0.01) in gmelina fruits compared to IVDMD (41.45%) and IVOMD (71.68%) of its leaves. In study 2, the nutrient digestibility and voluntary intake of 16 matured male sheep in CRD was determined. The voluntary dry matter intake (DMI) of 481.91 g/day, equivalent to 2.54% of body weight, and CPI of 77.78 g/day in sheep fed with gmelina leaves were higher (P<0.01) than the voluntary DMI (149.70 g/day), equivalent to 1.03% of body weight, and voluntary CPI (7.26 g/day) of those sheep fed with gmelina fruits. The coefficient of digestibility of nutrients in gmelina fruits were higher (P<0.01) than the gmelina leaves except for CP. The total digestible nutrient (TDN) of gmelina fruits (78.74%) was higher (P<0.01) than TDN of gmelina leaves (65.61%). In study 3, 20 weanling sheep were fed for 120 days to evaluate the average daily gain (ADG), feed efficiency (FE), hematological values, and economics of using gmelina leaves and fruits as supplement to paragrass. Results showed that DMI of sheep fed with gmelina leaves (520 g/day), gmelina fruits (500 g/day) and combination of leaves and fruits (519 g/day) as supplement to paragrass gave similar results but significantly lower (P<0.01) than the DMI (704 g/day) of sheep fed with paragrass alone. The ADG of sheep fed with gmelina leaves (36 g/day), gmelina fruits (26 g/day) and combination of gmelina leaves and fruits (32 g/day) as supplement to paragrass gave a significant increase (P<0.01) over the ADG (19 g/day) of sheep fed with paragrass alone. The FE of sheep fed with gmelina leaves (14.5 kg/kg), gmelina fruits (18.9 kg/kg) and combination of gmelina leaves and fruits (16.1 kg/kg) as supplement to paragrass gave similar results but higher (P<0.01) than the FE of sheep fed with paragrass alone (37.7 k/kg). Hematological evaluation showed that feeding of gmelina leaves and fruits had no deleterious effects on the physiological functions of the sheep.

The study aimed to strengthen the overall administrative capability of the DENR; to analyze the administrative culture of the DENR at Batangas; to identify the circumstances, persons involved, areas, manner and timing of the perceived negative bureaucratic behavior in that agency; to analyze the measures undertaken to solve this problem of negative bureaucratic behavior; and to analyze the impact of this perceived negative bureaucratic behavior to the agency\'s implementation of its plans, programs and projects. The study revealed a corrupt-prone administrative culture at the DENR in Batangas. The DENR employees dealt with one to three clients daily who go there to file applications/complaints/official matters, submit lacking requirements or comply with previous instructions, follow up their application/complaints/official matters and other unspecified purposes. These clients approached the DENR employees in a nice, polite and friendly manner but also name-drop or bring along a \"padrino.\" They offered gifts, money, or things of value to the DENR employees, right inside or nearby office premises or at other places including their houses. These offers were made upon the filing, following up, or approving applications/complaints/official matters, and during special occasions such as fiestas, birthdays, Christmas or anniversaries. Items offered were usually food and drinks, future help or assistance, services and small tokens. The respondents thought that accepting gifts and money from clients is not wrong if voluntarily offered and is even regarded as a reward mechanism. It was justified during special occasions like birthdays, fiestas and Christmas and in situations like inadequate salary and budget for field inspection/investigation and for supplies and materials. However, it was not justified by sharing the items to coemployees, and abhorred if done by DENR officials. Delay in the processing of papers was the usual complaint of clients particularly in the Lands Management and Environmental Management sectors. This was because of incomplete requirements, no inspection/investigation and no follow up. Paper processing was facilitated by completing the requirements, continuous follow up, and if the client was well known or with \"padrino.\" Officials were reshuffled, constant communication and monitoring were resorted and timetables were set to minimize corruption. The honest role of the Provincial Environmental and Natural Resources Office/Community Environmental and Natural Resources Office (PENRO/CENRO) was also highlighted in this study and the whole organization was recommended to undergo moral recovery program. Graft and corruption adversely effected the overall performance of the office and was a constraint toward DENR\'s performance.

Data were analyzed using frequency counts, percentages, indices, mean, standard deviation, and chi-square test. The mean age of the respondents was 35.88 years. Most of them attended school. Mean length of marriage was 15.98 years. Their mean annual family income, crop year 1985 was P11, 851.00. Majority belonged to the low-income group. The mean cultivated farm area was 1.54 ha. Most of the housewives have nuclear families and medium-sized households. Majority had low level of living. Most household activities were performed by the respondents; however, majority of the household decisions were made jointly with their husbands. Farm activities and decisions were primarily done and made by the respondents\' husbands. Household size and age of respondents influenced the decision-making pattern on remittance of children\'s wages and the kind of discipline appropriate for the children.

Results showed significantly high amount of organic matter carried by the ebb waters from the undisturbed site to the open seas. Highest values of export were obtained in July and August when rains and monsoons were prevalent and litterfall production was at peak. Among the four organic size categories, the dissolved organic matter concentration per liter of tidal water exceeded the particulate fractions. This was highest during the dry months when temperature was high. The particulate fractions (i.e., CPOM, MPOM, FPOM) were greater during the wet months than the dry months. The higher waters of the spring tides carried more dissolved materials while the lower waters of neap tides transported much of the particulate fractions. The caloric content of the transported organic matter during the wet months was higher than the dry months. The bulk of these materials during those months included seeds and fruits which had higher caloric values than the other vegetation parts. A comparison of the materials from the two study sites showed that the additional decomposing materials from the disturbed site yielded a higher caloric value. The soil in the mangroves had high organic content. The extensive rooting systems of the species in the undisturbed area served as traps for the litterfall produced which were then accumulated in the soils. The \"traps\" were relatively few in the disturbed area where tidal waters washed most of the materials. Thus, organic content was lowest at the surface soils of the disturbed site.

The descriptive method of research was used to evaluate this case. Collection of primary data was done through a survey using a combination of close- and open-ended questions. Interview guide questions were also prepared for obtaining data from key informants (KIS). The secondary data were gathered from official documents filed with the LGU. Total enumeration was considered because of limited number of respondents that was only 55. Descriptive statistics methods such as frequency count, percentage and mean were used in describing and analyzing the data gathered. The Spearman Rank Order Coefficient of Correlation was computed to determine the relationships between the independent variables (e.g. professional characteristics, extension resources, satisfaction, extension activities/services, and linkages) and the dependent variable that is the level of participation in the management of the devolved CBFPs. The management and implementation of the devolved CBFPs wee undertaken by professionally educated officials backed up by continuous training. Majority of the implementers had been employed long before and during devolution. They acknowledged their respective capabilities on the different roles/functions in the management of the CBFPs. The respondents perceived that there were insufficient human resources because of various devolved functions. However, the available financial resources allocated to the Environment and Natural Resources Office (ENRO) was perceived as sufficient. The facilities were in good condition especially those of the demo farm, office, and field work. Among the conditioning factors to satisfaction, the respondent\'s salary and other benefits and working conditions were sources of contentment together with the recognition received and type of work responsibilities assigned them. The choice of extension services/activities were based on the interest and thrust of the LGU because of economic benefits derived. The major choices and important extension activities identified were watershed management; soil management and conservation; sand, gravel and mine investigation; mango farm development; ecological rehabilitation; and ecological waste management. The intra- inter-initiated linkages introduced by the governor and the ENRO linkages with national government agencies, people\'s organization and foreign institutions were the most frequent collaborations undertaken. Respondents seldom participated in planning activities while most fairly participated in monitoring and evaluation activities. The professional characteristics, particularly the position of the respondents, had a strong degree of association with the level of participation in monitoring and evaluation activities while the availability of physical resources had moderate association with the level of participation in planning and monitoring. The conditioning factors to work satisfaction were moderately associated with the level of participation in planning and evaluation. The choice of extension activities/services were moderately associated with the level of participation in evaluation. The dynamic extension management with its flexibility, allowing implementors to innovate resulted in the creation of the ENRO, PENR Council, and the organization of the ISF federation.

Data were gathered using interview schedules designed for each of the three key players of RRDIS, namely, RRDIS staff, researchers, and end-users. Aside from the interviews, actual observation and analysis of records, and other related documents were employed to validate the data. All the components for an effective management of information, such as data gathering, classifying, organizing, storing, retrieving, packaging, and making information available to the users were adopted by the RRDIS. However, results showed that only a few of the RRDIS staff were familiar with the process involved in managing agricultural technology information. This study also revealed that the Department of Agriculture was often cited as the most active player among the agencies involved in managing RRDIS. Research results also revealed that the technologies were classified based on commodities like livestock, root crops, abaca, vegetables, etc. Findings also showed that extension workers were the major clients of RRDIS. They used the information materials in reaching out to farmers, who were supposed to be the end-users of information in the database.

Abaca mosaic incidence increased with time and was highest in Amguhan. Apparent infection rates of the disease were 0.03 plants/month, 0.02 plants/month and 0.05 plants /month for Sapa 1, Sapa 2, and Amguhan, respectively. The disease increased 1.8 times or almost doubled in 12 months after a one-time unsustained eradication activity. A 3.9-average of abaca mosaic regrowths per hill was observed as a result of unsuccessful and incomplete hill eradication of abaca mosaic-infested abaca hill or mat. It appeared that unsustained eradication was no guarantee that the disease will be effectively controlled. Annual percent disease increases were 8.8% and 16.07% for Sapa and Amguhan, respectively. With these rates, the likelihood that the abaca plantations in the two barangays being wiped out was high. Weather factors had no direct effect on disease incidence. The random movements of the various aphid species acting as vectors of abaca mosaic resulted in the patternless disease spread in the experimental sites. The disease had affected 212 ha in Sapa and 201.8 ha in Amguhan corresponding to a total yield loss of 8,050.14 kg and 7.684.22 kg and equivalent to P144,902.52 and P138,315.90, respectively. Rates of increase in prevalence were 0.06 and 0.04 farms/month for Sapa and Amguhan, respectively. With these rates, it was estimated that the remaining unaffected abaca plantations in the two barangays would all be infected in three years time. The fast rate of disease increase indicated the looming catastrophe posed to the abaca industry in Eastern Visayas. Eradication activities should be fast enough to keep pace with the disease and complete eradication of all possible sources of inocula, periodic inspection and surveys were necessary to attain success. Trapped aphids in Baybay, Leyte were: Aphis gossypii Glover, A. spiraecola Patch, Ceratovacuna lanigera Zehntner, Greenidea formosana (Maki), Pentalonia nigronervosa infested abaca plants in the sites. Abaca mosaic incidence was not correlated with the total number of aphids and number of alate aphids per plant but highly correlated with the number of trapped aphids in the area. Abaca mosaic disease incidence continued to increase progressively as the number of trapped aphids increased. Temperature and relative humidity showed profound effect on the number of alate aphids per plant and number of trapped aphids, respectively. Wind velocity showed significant influence on abaca mosaic incidence. Temperature in the sites favored multiplication and wing bud formation of aphids. Wind velocity also favored aphid take-off and enhanced movements of alate aphids in the different abaca plantations. Severity levels of abaca mosaic significantly reduced the tensile strength, biomass yield, fiber yield, plant height and stalk diameter of abaca plants. Abaca mosaic disease affected all stages of plant growth in the field. Relationships between disease severity and tensile strength, total fiber yield, biomass yield, plant height, stem diameter and total gross income were described by the following equations: Y = 33.02 - 2.30X; Y = 414.31 - 47.52X; Y = 13.71 - 0.489X; Y = 587.28 - 28.81X; Y = 52.58 - 4.16X; and Y = 15703 - 2120.02X, respectively. Coefficients of determination (R2) values for all the parameters regressed were all highly significant at one percent level of significance. Abaca mosaic severity levels significantly reduced the gross income of farmers. As disease intensity increased, total gross income decreased. A per hectare annual loss of P26,184.06 or a regional annual loss of P977,825,391.90 would occur if abaca mosaic affected the abaca plantations at severity level 5.',NULL,NULL,'Lacorte, Vanica R.','blast$xplant diseases, brown spot$xplant diseases, Oryza sativa, IR64$xrice, rice, Agriculture',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(3115,'2021-09-01 07:44:55','2021-09-01 07:44:55','Systems analysis of rice-beef cattle production system under rainfed lowland condition in Pangasinan, Philippines.','2021-09-01','This study investigated and provided quantitative measures on the degree of integration between rice and cattle in the rainfed lowland rice. Preliminary to the actual modeling procedure, the profile and availability of feed resources were initially determined based on the conditions in Barangay Carosucan, Sta. Barbara, Pangasinan. Herbage collection from designated plots was undertaken in paddy fields during fallow period from November 1997 to May 1998 and from the bunds year round (November 1997 - October 1998). More specifically, collection of biomass during the fallow period was done on 30-, 45- and 60-days cutting intervals, while collection from bunds were done monthly. Samples were analyzed for dry matter (DM) content, crude protein (CP) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) including in-vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD). Measurements of total available nutrients from the paddy field were used as input to the logical model to simulate the cycle of liveweight changes in cattle under rainfed lowland rice. Rice straw constituted a major bulk of the feed resources that were offered to cattle in the area. A total of 15 species of weeds and grasses was identified, of which 11 were found in the bunds and 13 from the paddy field during fallow. The bund was estimated to occupy 5.52% of the entire farmer\'s field. In all biomass collections both from the bunds and paddy field, Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon) was the most important species for animal feeds in the area. Monthly chemical composition of the herbage that was collected from the bunds showed a relatively higher percentage DM average during the dry season (44.13%) than during the wet season (32.3%). On the contrary, a higher average percentage CP on DM basis, was obtained during the wet (9.9%) than during the dry season (6.32%). No distinct pattern in percentage NDF and IVDMD was observed which ranged from 64.48% to 66.39% and 36.18% to 61.48%, respectively. For the paddy field under fallow, percentage DM of herbage collected was highest in April (55.75%) and lowest in November (32.12%). Percentage CP ranged from 4.39% to 7.68% while percentage NDF remained fairly uniform from 63.95% to 66.39%. Percentage IVDMD widely ranged from 23.45% to 54.72%. Annual production of DM with the model was generated to logically describe the flow of nutrients that took place among the three subsystems, namely, rice, weeds and cattle. The model predicted animal weight that was within the range of expected values for the different feeding scenarios. Simulated growth rates based on existing feed resources availability showed that rainfed lowland rice can be a source of sufficient forage materials all year round at least for one head of cattle.',NULL,NULL,'Madid, Cassiophiea M.','mangrove$xforest resources management$zTayabas Bay, Forestry',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(3116,'2021-09-01 07:44:55','2021-09-01 07:44:55','Utilization of the barks of industrial tree plantation species (ITPS) adsorbent of heavy metals and their recycling and reuse for composite panel production.','2021-09-01','The barks of industrial tree plantation species (ITPS) were utilized as adsorbent of heavy metals. The adsorptive capacity of ITPS barks in removing heavy metals in prepared synthetic wastewater and wastewater from a galvanizing plant followed the order: Pb>Cr>Cu>Zn. All the ITPS barks selectively removed Pb2+ ions. The barks of ITPS treated with formaldehyde in acidic medium reduced the water soluble color of the barks and showed lower adsorption capacity than the untreated ones. Equilibrium adsorption studies of Endospermum peltatum bark showed that as the amount of the bark increased, the amount of the metals adsorbed also increased. However, the removal of metals became independent when time of contact was increased. The effect of initial solution pH on the adsorption of Cu2+, Cr 6+ and Zn2+ using E. peltatum bark showed an increase in the removal rate for Cu2+ but not for Cr 6+ and Zn2+ as pH was increased. At higher metal concentration, the amount of adsorbed metals was lower which could be due to the decrease in the binding sites on the surface of the bark. The adsorption of Cu2+ was found to be pore diffusion controlled. Zn2+ was the least adsorbed metal. A simulated column test conducted prior to the actual adsorption test using wastewater from a galvanizing treatment plant showed that E. peltatum bark became saturated with heavy metals after six hours of contact. Barks of E. camaldulensis, E. pelattum and G. arborea were loaded in the wastewater treatment plant for 24 hours for maximum uptake of heavy metals. The amount of the adsorbed Zn2+ ranged from 4.72 mg/g bark to 4.95 mg/g bark for the three barks and the amount of desorption was from 0.01 mg/g bark to 0.08 mg/g bark. The metal-saturated barks of ITPS were recycled to produce cement-bonded boards (CBB). CBB made from the bark of G. arborea were too weak to be tested for strength properties. On the other hand, there was no marked difference on the strength properties of the control and recycled E. camaldulensis and E. peltatum bark. The leaching properties of the CBB from recycled barks showed higher values for Cu2+ and low values for Zn2+. Generally, metal-saturated barks of ITPS have the potential to be recycled and reused as composite panel boards.',NULL,NULL,'Rafosala, Ben-Hur C.','mango$xrheological properties, Engineering',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(3117,'2021-09-01 07:44:55','2021-09-01 07:44:55','Communication structure and its impact in enhancing people\'s participation in agricultural research and natural resources management.','2021-09-01','Participation in agriculture and natural resources management is the key to overcoming the social and communication failures of traditional top-down initiatives. Better participation and involvement of the local people ensure that development interventions genuinely benefit the community in terms of improvement in livelihood opportunities, food and nutrition security, and better environmental management. This study was a modest attempt to contribute to a better understanding and appreciation of the influence of communication in enhancing people\'s participation in the SANREM-UPWARD Homegardening Workplan involving 21 pilot homegardeners in 12 barangays across Manupali watershed in Lantapan, Bukidnon. The assumption was that, the structure of communication system provides a macroscopic view of the otherwise invisible relationship between communication and level of participation. This case study made use of the complete enumeration method in the selection of sample. Data were gathered using a structured interview schedule. Results showed that the Homegardening Workplan has led to the development of self-reliance among the 21 women pilot homegardeners. Under the program, the homegardeners were able to lead in the homegarden trials, setting example for other local people to follow. Information and technology gained from the Workplan were shared, as well as planting materials and garden crops harvested. Majority of the pilot homegardeners\' families live below the poverty level and barely subsist with what they have. The higher income groups were mainly found in the middle and lower agroecological zones, while those with incomes below P1000/month were mostly located in the upper agroecological zones. This exemplifies the relationship between the social system and the ecosystem. Interpersonal communication as determined, influenced, and affected by the people\'s values, prior exposure and knowledge, and the appropriateness and relevance of the information to their needs, was the most effective form of communication in a participatory development intervention such as the Homegardening Workplan. Information flow was predominantly vertical (from the project staff to the participants), despite the supposedly participatory nature of the Workplan. Based on the information-seeking behavior of the homegardeners, the development intervention was still top-down. Most of the homegardeners were encouraged/requested by their local leaders to join the Workplan. Their involvement did not evolve from a gradual penetration of the site, nor from a genuine understanding of the local people\'s problems. The Homegardening Workplan has benefited the respondents in tems of material, social and personal benefits. Material benefits included: increase in household nutrition and increase in harvest through alternative technologies introduced and availability of planting materials. Social benefits included: access to services of agricultural technicians and information sharing. Personal benefits included: self-reliance, self-esteem and sense of efficiency. The findings suggested that the Workplan had raised the awareness of the local people on the potentials of homegardening. Awareness-raising, however, was far from being participatory. In general, despite the supposedly participatory, action-oriented and field-based nature of the Workplan, the pilot homegardeners perceived their role in the program as only in the level of implementor/beneficiary, where they take no part in the identification of project activities or discussions about implementation and evaluation. It is recommended that a mechanism that will create an enabling environment for homegardeners to sustainably manage their homegardens even after the program has disengaged from the site be developed. Further research is recommended to explore and establish the influence of interdisciplinary factors on participative behavior, to ensure that genuine participation is achieved--the true measure of which is empowerment of the people.',NULL,NULL,'Mamucod, Henry F.','Food science and technology, Monascus purpureus$xfood additives, red molds, angkak$xfood additives',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(3118,'2021-09-01 07:44:55','2021-09-01 07:44:55','Effects of desiccation on the morpho-anatomical, physiological and biochemical characteristics of durian (Durio zibethinus Murr), seeds.','2021-09-01','Three studies were conducted to: 1) determine the physiological, biochemical and morpho-anatomical responses of durian seeds to dessication and low temperature, and 2) develop a suitable technique for short-term storage of durian seeds. Durian seeds were highly sensitive to dessication when air- or sun-dried and when subjected to low temperature of 15?C and 5?C for 15-30 days. There was a strong positive correlation (r= -0.97) between moisture content (MC) and germination and a strong negative corrrelation (r= -0.99) between electrical conductivity and germination. The higher electrical conductivity, the lower is the seed viability. A significant increase in the germination rate and peroxidase activity was observed with the coresponding reduction in seed viability. The presence of large amount of soluble sugars, particularly the nonreducing sugar component within the cell, failed to prevent the damage or disruption in the integrity of the membrane. The nonreducing sugars decreased significantly with the gradual reduction in the seed viability. Storing durian seeds with high MC in moist sawdust, wrapped with aluminum foil maintained the viability of the seeds for one month. A higher germination of 90% at storage was obtained when seeds were kept in moist sawdust compared with 32.5% when wrapped with aluminum foil.

The common notion of technology transfer in the agriculture sector is based on the traditional view of innovation in which technologies and techniques are assumed to flow essentially unchanged from one location to another in a linear fashion. The technology transfer approaches of interveners in the agriculture sector have been generally top-down. While these approaches have achieved some degree of success, these have not been sufficiently far-reaching to spur the growth of rural economy. This thesis questioned the linear and top-down orientation of technology transfer both as explanation and as prescription in the context of the agricultural research and extension system in the Philippines. The central assumption of the thesis was that technology transfer in agriculture can be best understood as a social and political process. In this context, four levels of analysis were undertaken. First, theories and models associated with technology transfer were reviewed to determine the extent to which they explain or influence the technology transfer approaches in the agriculture sector. Second, the political economy of the agriculture sector and technology transfer was examined to understand the actions of the Philippine state toward agricultural development and the context in which other sectors operate. Third, the immediate setting of the technology transfer process, which is the agricultural research and extension system, was analyzed in terms of the roles, policies, strategies and interrelationships of the different actors. Fourth, detailed case studies of three agricultural cooperatives in the Philippines were used to examine the dynamics and complexities of the technology transfer process at the field level. The traditional innovation and diffusion models were reasonable depiction of most of the technology transfer practices in  developing countries including the Philippines. The actions of participants were limited in part by the largely bureaucratic structure of agricultural research and extension, and also shaped by the domestic and global political economy. These models have been used within the context of the economic development policies of Philippine governments which in recent years have been export-oriented and foreign investment-led. The case studies demonstrated the various approaches to technology transfer. In particular, one case illustrated the successful balance between top-down and bottom-up approaches to rural intervention. Another case showed the complexities of a develoment project funded by a foreign donor. The case studies indicated that farmer participation and institution building are important ingredients for successful technology transfer projects along with research and development, technology and support services. The thesis concluded that technology transfer mechanisms and policies must consider the intricacies of the larger environment within which the agricultural research and extension system operates. It suggested the importance of understanding the contradictions, opportunities, socio-political processess and constraints within the political economy environment of the agriculture sector. This knowledge is useful for developing technology transfer strategies that will overcome such contradictions and constraints. The thesis also argued for the application of technology transfer approaches that provide clear mechanisms for participation by farmers. Technology transfer programs have the best potential to achieve broad-based development when these focus on strengthening rural organizations-the foundation upon which appropriate rural-based socioeconomic activities could emerge and be sustained.',NULL,NULL,'Aguilon, Dianne Joy D.','Zoology, African armyworm$xTemperature$vThesis$yExperimentation, Spodoptera exempta$xTemperature$vThesis$yExperimentation, African armyworm$xHost plant$vThesis$yExperimentation, Spodoptera exempta$xHost plant$vThesis$yExperimentation',NULL,15,7,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(3120,'2021-09-01 07:44:55','2021-09-01 07:44:55','Profitability analysis : 25-doe level goat production','2021-09-01','',NULL,NULL,'Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development (PCAARRD)','',NULL,15,8,4,NULL,NULL,'00:00:00',NULL,NULL,0,0),(3121,'2021-09-02 05:33:03','2021-09-02 05:33:03','Project SARAi: iCMF Corn Bulletin for August – December 2021 based on July 2021 Condition','2021-09-02','This August- December period is a critical period for corn production in our country.

This region is also home to several private and government institutions; state colleges, and universities; and R&amp;D agencies with a vast pool of scientists and technologists specializing in agriculture, environment, and natural resources abound in the region.</p><p>The R&amp;D sector saw the need to genuinely collaborate efforts to boost the agro-industrial and sustainable development in the region. However, the wide geographical spread of the region makes the facilitation and coordination of R&amp;D work difficult. Hence on May 3, 1988, the Southern Tagalog Agriculture, and Resources Research, Development Consortium (STARRDEC) was established thru the partnership of 12 agencies, namely; Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Training Institute Region IV (DA-ATI IV); Department of Agriculture - Bureau of Agricultural Research (DA-BAR); Department of Agriculture Region IV (DA-IV); Department of Environment and Natural Resources Region IV (DENR-IV); Department of Science and Technology Region IV (DOST-IV); Don Severino Agricultural College (DSAC); Ecosystems Research and Development Bureau (ERDB); Forest Products Research and Development Institute (FPRDI); National Economic and Development Authority Region IV (NEDA-IV); Philippine Council for Agriculture, and Natural Resources Research and Development (PCARRD); Palawan National Agricultural College (PNAC); and University of the Philippines - Los Baños (UPLB). It was based and hosted by UPLB from 1988-2007.</p><p>On January 31, 2007, during the 62nd Regional Research and Development Coordinating Committee (RRDCC) Meeting&nbsp;held at UPLB DA-BAR-RDE Network Building, College, Laguna, Resolution No. 4 Series of 2007 was approved&nbsp;declaring the transfer of hosting of the consortium from UPLB to DSAC, now known as Cavite State University (CvSU),&nbsp;to allow other member agencies to host the consortium.</p><p>In 2008, CvSU started hosting the consortium. On April 21, 2015, during the RRDCC Chairpersons, Consortium Directors, Fisheries Zonal Center Representatives, and PCAARRD Officials’ Meeting cum Workshop held at Hotel Kimberly, Tagaytay City, the Resolution on Enhancing PCAARRD’s Engagement with the Regional Consortia was approved declaring that the consortia will integrate the agriculture and aquatic sectors and re-engage with PCAARRD reflecting the aquatic sector in acronym thus becoming STAARRDEC.</p><p>On December 15, 2015, during the 82nd RRDCC Meeting, the renaming of the consortium to read as the Southern&nbsp;Tagalog Agriculture, Aquatic and Resources Research, Development and Extension Consortium was approved&nbsp;and was used in 2016 and onwards.</p><p>Today, after more than 3 decades from its establishment, the consortium has now 21 member institutions (10 SUCs, 3&nbsp;National Line Agencies, and 8 Regional Line Agencies) with CvSU as its host agency.</p><p><strong>Vision</strong></p><p>Leading regional consortium in market-driven researches for growth&nbsp;and development.</p><p><br><strong>Mission</strong></p><p>STAARRDEC shall engage in building agriculture, aquatic,&nbsp;environment, and natural resources research and development&nbsp;programs; technology utilization and commercialization; policy&nbsp;formulation and advocacy; capability building; resource generation; and&nbsp;multi-stakeholder partnerships.</p><p><br><strong>Mandates</strong></p><p>STAARRDEC is mandated to:</p><p>Determine the regional research and development priorities including budgetary&nbsp;allocations for specific projects of member-agencies;</p><p>Coordinate the planning and implementation of an integrated regional research and&nbsp;development programs and related activities in agriculture, aquatic, environment and&nbsp;natural resources;</p><p>Develop strategies to generate RD&amp;E funds, develop RD&amp;E resources, and exercise&nbsp;research management attuned to the Region in support of national goals and priorities;</p><p>Develop mechanisms toward the effective utilization of the outputs of RD&amp;E thereby&nbsp;generating employment and enhancing economic growth in the Region;</p><p>Initiate and coordinate interagency efforts on the refinement, commercialization, and&nbsp;utilization of technology in partnership with Local Government Units (LGUs); and</p><p>Carry out management information and applied communication programs to provide&nbsp;support services, ensure effective dissemination of RD&amp;E information and encourage&nbsp;their utilization by various clients.</p>','Dr. Marilyn M.

Affirming the role of S&amp;T in development, PCARR changed its name to Philippine Council for Agriculture and Resources Research and Development (PCARRD) in 1982. The Council was tasked to provide a unified and focused direction for the country’s agricultural research. It then became an apex organization that supports and manages the national network of government and higher education institutions involved in crops, livestock, forestry, fisheries, soil and water, mineral resources, and socio-economic research and development (R&amp;D). In 1987, the Council was renamed the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources Research and Development but retained the acronym PCARRD. On January&nbsp;30 of the same year created the Philippine Council for Aquatic and Marine Research and Development (PCAMRD) from the Fisheries Research Division of PCARRD with functions focused on aquatic and marine sectors.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With expanded coverage, functions, and responsibilities, the Council formulates policies, plans, and programs for science and technology-based R&amp;D in the different sectors under its concern. It coordinates, evaluates, and monitors the national R&amp;D efforts in the agriculture, aquatic, and natural resources (AANR) sector. It also allocates government and external funds for R&amp;D and generates resources to support its program.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the apex Council of the AANR sector, PCAARRD is engaged in active partnerships with international, regional, and national organizations and funding institutions for joint R&amp;D, human resource development and training, technical assistance, and exchange of scientists, information, and technologies. The Council is implementing its program primarily through its Research and Development and Extension Consortia which are located all over the country.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It also supports the National Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development Network (NAARRDN) composed of national multi- and single-commodity and regional R&amp;D centers, cooperating stations, and specialized agencies.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Being an ISO 9001:2015-certified agency for its quality management system, PCAARRD is committed to achieving a sustained dynamic leadership in science and technology (S&amp;T) innovation in the AANR sector by providing a strategic leadership in promoting S&amp;T as a platform for AANR products innovation and environment resiliency. Guided by its core values of relevance, excellence, and cooperation, PCAARRD will remain steadfast in catalyzing the Philippine AANR sector toward self-sufficiency and global competitiveness</p>','Dr. Reynaldo V.

It was formed through the consolidation of the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources Research and Development (PCARRD) and the Philippine Council for Aquatic and Marine Research and Development (PCAMRD) on June 22, 2011 pursuant to Executive Order No. 366.</p><p>        Originally established in November 1972 as the Philippine Council for Agricultural Research (PCAR), it became the Philippine Council for Agriculture and Resources Research (PCARR) to include mines research in 1975. Affirming the role of S&T in development, PCARR changed its name to Philippine Council for Agriculture and Resources Research and Development (PCARRD) in 1982. The Council was tasked to provide a unified and focused direction for the country’s agricultural research. It then became an apex organization that supports and manages the national network of government and higher education institutions involved in crops, livestock, forestry, fisheries, soil and water, mineral resources, and socio-economic research and development (R&D). In 1987, the Council was renamed the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources Research and Development but retained the acronym PCARRD. On January 30 of the same year created the Philippine Council for Aquatic and Marine Research and Development (PCAMRD) from the Fisheries Research Division of PCARRD with functions focused on aquatic and marine sectors.</p><p>       With expanded coverage, functions, and responsibilities, the Council formulates policies, plans, and programs for science and technology-based R&D in the different sectors under its concern. It coordinates, evaluates, and monitors the national R&D efforts in the agriculture, aquatic, and natural resources (AANR) sector. It also allocates government and external funds for R&D and generates resources to support its program.</p><p>        As the apex Council of the AANR sector, PCAARRD is engaged in active partnerships with international, regional, and national organizations and funding institutions for joint R&D, human resource development and training, technical assistance, and exchange of scientists, information, and technologies. The Council is implementing its program primarily through its Research and Development and Extension Consortia which are located all over the country.</p><p>      It also supports the National Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development Network (NAARRDN) composed of national multi- and single-commodity and regional R&D centers, cooperating stations, and specialized agencies.</p><p>       Being an ISO 9001:2015-certified agency for its quality management system, PCAARRD is committed to achieving a sustained dynamic leadership in science and technology (S&T) innovation in the AANR sector by providing a strategic leadership in promoting S&T as a platform for AANR products innovation and environment resiliency. Guided by its core values of relevance, excellence, and cooperation, PCAARRD will remain steadfast in catalyzing the Philippine AANR sector toward self-sufficiency and global competitiveness</p><p> </p><p>Address: Paseo de Valmayor, Timugan, Economic Garden Los Baños, Laguna 4030 Philippines    </p><p>Liaison Office 2F Metrology Center, ITDI DOST Compound, Bicutan, Taguig City, Manila </p><p><strong>For Data Privacy Concerns:</strong><br>Dr. Richard E.
